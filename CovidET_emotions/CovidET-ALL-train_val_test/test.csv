I feel so so powerless. So guilty I didnt reply to his phone call 3 days earlier as my family was also sick of Covid and I was caring for them. The death feels like it could have been avoided, he took the remaining precautions but it didnt work. At least he died happy alongside his family in his hometown where I live.

As a result, many people are fearing that COVID-19 restrictions will be constantly looming over us for the rest of human history, persistently drifting in and out of our lives. I'd like to explain why these fears simply are not rational. Despite what some say, Israel has not achieved herd immunity. They are very close, of course, but they are not at that milestone *yet.* About 5,160,000 Israelis are fully vaccinated, equivalent to roughly 56% of the Israeli population is fully vaccinated. Add that to all the Israelis who have attained natural immunity from the virus, and the percentage rate of immunity within Israel arrives at roughly 66%. For a group to have herd immunity to COVID-19, 70% must be immune. Because Israel has yet to achieve herd immunity, it is still possible for an outbreak to take place. Even with this in mind, the outbreak Israel has been facing is minuscule compared to the size of outbreaks at any point in 2020.

12,o7y52c,6/25/2021 22:29,"The following has been my experience: Started showing Covid symptoms at the beginning of May 2021. They lasted about two and a half weeks. After the third and a half week or so, I felt well enough to put in a full workout. I did so, and 48 hours later, my Covid symptoms had returned in pretty much full force. I've read about different forms ""long Covid"" takes - it's not always persistent - some report reinfection or reactivation of Covid after periods of dormancy. Two weeks after my initial reactivation, my symptoms begin to subside. I decide to get the first Covid vaccine (I read that in some ""vaccine vanguard"" countries like Israel, they were recommending one covid shot for those who had already had the virus). I get the first shot, and feel a little not great for about 48 hours or so (mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some fatigue, weakness), but afterwards I begin to feel great, better than I had at any point since before I got Covid in early May. A week ago I put in a full exercise. About 24 hours later, I don't feel like I felt when I had Covid, but I definitely feel the exact same as I did *after* I had gotten my first shot - mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some weakness. I am under the impression working out a second time ""reactivated"" dormant Covid, but the vaccine kicked back in and enlisted my immune system in fighting this second activation.

29,o93rqd,6/27/2021 19:25,"Hey, everyone, just in a particularly dark patch, and feeling the need for some dialogue. I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year. Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic hit, but then, after 15 months of slow, grinding lockdowns, endless bad news on top of bad news, and nowhere to go to get away from it... Is it really a wonder why everyone is so unhappy all the time? I feel like a machine that's trying harder and harder to run without lubricant, to the point that it's just scraping metal-on-metal, and every day is a bit harder than the last. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to keep this up. The possibility of a variant wave in the Fall, forcing us back into yet another lockdown, terrifies me. I can't relax, I can't focus, and it's been seven or eight months since I've had any meaningful hope for the future. This late in the game, I just... can't shake the feeling that things will never get better. 2019 was the best things will ever be in my lifetime, and it's all downhill from here.",3RWE2M8QWRLLYFAEN9YAPWE3XPGN0S,AM6H40LNWSFYA,"['disgust', 'sadness']","['boredom', 'grief']","[""lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic hit, but then, after 15 months of slow, grinding lockdowns, endless bad news on top of bad news, and nowhere to go to get away from it... is it really a wonder why everyone is so unhappy all the time?"", ""i can't relax, i can't focus, and it's been seven or eight months since i've had any meaningful hope for the future.""]","[""i feel so drained from the pandemic that i don't have any energy left to go on with this.

But we also have two kids (age 5 and 3) in our family. Obviously they can't get vaccinated. Hearing that Delta is very transmissible, and often even infects vaccinated folk, scares me. I know efficiency of the vaccines was never 100% but I believed at least we'd be safe from Covid when we get vaccinated. I work full-time and go to school. At school, everyone wears a mask, we are 1,5m apart, the windows are open and everyone gets tested daily. At work, my coworker wears a mask and so do I. When I eat or drink I go outside. Otherwise, I don't take off my mask at all (I wear FFP2 or FFP3). My boss doesn't wear a mask but he only occasionally comes into our office. Also, everyone at my work place had Corona three months ago except me. They caught Alpha (B117). I also have to take public transit. Everyone wears masks. Windows are open. How big is my risk of infection?

My forearms became incredibly itchy for about 2-3 days, but I never developed a rash or anything of the sorts.

While the last year and a half have been trying emotionally and professionally for all of us, things are looking up with the vaccine. However, my wife's parents refuse to get vaccinated. They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws. This is becoming a big problem because I am building a startup and my cofounder is someone I met during the pandemic. He and I need to start building a more regular working cadence and relationship, but this is really difficult since my wife and SIL are not comfortable with me working in person with him, even though he is vaccinated (though he is much less careful than us). For my part, I would like to push the company forward, and agree that our creative work would improve if we were able to work in-person a couple of times per week. I'm just at a loss - my wife is grieving what she perceives as the loss of her parents' sanity and doesn't want to cut them off, but I face real professional challenges (let alone the ongoing personal and mental health challenges) from continuing the status quo. Guiltily, I feel very angry at them - I feel like they are offloading responsibility for their safety on my wife, SIL, and myself, which seems extremely selfish.

92,oga1in,7/8/2021 15:53,"This lockdown has gone on forever. From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this.

Now that things are the way they are in the US, I've been trying to make an effort to see each of my friends at least once this summer, especially as I'll be moving across the country at the end of August. But these days, I've been finding myself completely wiped out after meeting up with one friend for 2-3 hours. As in... after I get home, I spend the rest of the day slowly building up the energy to even do minor errands around the house (but most of the time I just sink into the couch and stare at the TV for the rest of the day). I've also been purposely scheduling only one hangout every 3-4 days as my energy levels are only really better after that many days. Is this completely out of the ordinary? Pre-pandemic, I used to be able to handle seeing my coworkers every day, socializing and interacting with them throughout the day and at lunch, and would usually schedule dinner or a hangout with a friend every other day no problem. I feel so wrung out and tired after these hangouts, that I'm not even sure I've had fun by the end of them...

When the pandemic hit, I was a junior so the rest of my high school experience was in the pandemic. I, recently, graduated back in June (in person luckily). For a graduation present, my parents got tickets for Disneyland for my 3 friends (all fully vaccinated). My family and I have been very proactive when it comes to Covid related things. The reason for this is for my brother who has Down Syndrome. Sadly, he is still to young enough to get vaccinated but will be before the end of the year (thank god). Before being vaccinated, I was only able to see my friends in person only a handful of times since the start of the pandemic. Now things are (hopefully) going in a better direction in America and I am struggling to decide if I should wear a mask at Disneyland. It is surreal to even consider not wearing masks in general. I feel confused about information because the CDC says it is safe to do so but the WHO recommends masks for everyone regardless of vaccination status.

No. There are other regions that are highly vaccinated where such mandates will probably not be necessary. Aside from Los Angeles, where else in California have masks been mandated? That said if you are vaccinated, you are still well protected. And better yet, if you live in a region where the virus is not circulating, then of course it's safe to take off your mask.

Around Wednesday friend started showing symptoms, we both got tests Thursday and results yesterday. He was positive I was negative so he went into isolation in his room. This morning I woke up with aches and took my temp and it was higher than normal 100.9. Not too bad but am fairly certain it means I have covid. They've both lost their senses of taste, the first friend had more symptoms she had a high fever and was puking, fatigued, says today it's hard to breathe but she's fine otherwise. Friend I live with has a cough qnd headaches and congestion but energy is fine. I turn 30 in 2 days, the whole thing just sucks. If it's rare how did we all get it? We've all been fully vaxxed for a couple months. I feel like I just never understand what's happening even though I'm constantly reading about it.

According to graphs in Scotland, the variant may hit hard and fast, but it ultimately doesn't do as bad a damage as other variants. In fact, Scotland's cases peaked at June 30 after having a big spike. But now the cases have since crashed. Big time. More importantly, the hospitalization's peak, two weeks after, topped out at 1/4 that of Alpha. Again, most of that has to do with how vaccinated Scotland was. More interestingly, the most vaccinated regions didn't have such a major impact with it and barely had any huge numbers. The unvaccinated ones, on the other hand, did. What does all this mean? One, it means that perhaps the Delta Variant wave won't be as long or as massively damaging as some people are fearing, and two, the vaccine helps. Again, the more we vaccinate, the faster we'll be out of this. But having said that, the Delta Variant's wave thankfully may not be as lengthy.

Anyway I saw this article today on NBC news as website and believe it or not it makes me feel a whole lot better. According to this article 27 states have kept monitoring their number of breakthrough infections since the vaccinations have started. According to this the totals are around 65,000, though to be fair thats not accurate since more than likely theres many more of those other 23 states so for the sake of argument lets assume that all of those other states have the exact same amount so will make our maximum amount 130,000.

Knew I probably shouldn't go but I knew I was vaccinated so I thought I'd be fine. Fast forward to Sunday evening and im getting some fatigue/body aches and a scratchy throat. I've been dealing with some chronic acid reflux &amp; asthma stuff since March 2020 and have had spells of scratchy throats and body aches before so I figured it was just another one of those popping up. They usually went away in a day or two. The thought of going to the wrestling show was still in the back of my mind though. By Monday night I had a cough and congested sinuses. So finally this morning I got up and did a rapid test and sure enough it came back positive. Told everyone I went to the show with and everyone I'd seen since (including my parents ugh) and all got tested today or are getting tested tomorrow. Most from today have come back negative thankfully. So now im just sitting here with a sore throat, cough, stuffy nose and sinus headache crossing my fingers that it doesn't get any worse and that I didn't end up infecting my parents. Any other recovered breakthroughers on here?

230,ophz0r,7/22/2021 16:55,"An argument I often hear with regards to our path towards herd immunity is that there could be natural immunity on top of vaccinations. And that as covid continues to spread among the unvaccinated, it would bring us closer to herd immunity through natural infections. However, whenever I see this argument, I start to doubt if natural immunity could actually be of any help. And this concern is due to one thing: variants. From what I've heard, natural immunity doesn't protect as well against some variants, such as Delta. They could still be reinfected with Delta even if they had a prior infection from the original strain. Not sure how common this is, though, and I've heard that natural immunity can still protect against Delta, so I'm taking this with a grain of salt. However, given the progressively worse variants we've witnessed over the past few months (first B.1.1.7, and now Delta), I often worry about the following possibility: 1. COVID spreads like wildfire among the unvaccinated 2. Because it's spreading like wildfire, a new variant emerges 3. This hypothetical variant is even worse than the last, and can reinfect you even if you've had prior infection from previous strains. 4. This new variant goes to reinfect those who have been infected with previous strains, and spreads like wildfire among them. 5. Rinse and repeat It is this thought that often makes it difficult to see that all pandemics end eventually, usually after a few years. It makes me worried that if we go the natural immunity route, we will just be stuck in this perpetual cycle with each iteration producing a worse variant, as long as there are large numbers of unvaccinated people. Is there something missing from my logic here? [I have heard that viruses will eventually reach a point of ""peak fitness""]([url] where it has evolved to optimal survival conditions.

260,orkz8m,7/25/2021 21:57,"TL;DR: Finally our city is getting vaccinated on age rank 30 to 39, however the vaccines they are delivering are SINOVAC, that is told being less efective against Delta variant, the one is rising on whole Mxico. Ok, so this will be a bit long maybe. So, today our State Goverment announced that they received 134,400 doses of vaccines for the City Metropolitan area, for people of age 30 to 39 (Total population of the urban area: around 5.35 million). However, the issue is: the vaccine the federal goverment is sending is Sinovac (Previously they where sending Pfizer and Astra Zeneca, and for the teachers they send Cansino). Unfortunately while searching for information, i got the data that the efficiency of Sinovac is barely above 50% And IDK what to think or to do. IMO the best is efficiency above 70% that most vaccines get. This would mean that if i got Sinovac, I will still need to keep isolated for a longer time and i'm getting extremely tired for that. And also the rumors run that Sinovac isn't effective enought against Delta Variant, that seems to be the variant raising here at Mxico. I still don't have the money or the visa to travel USA to get a shot from another brand, i would have done that if i had the resources. But i'm feeling ""tied"" since our freaking federal goverment its handling all at worst. I know that 50% chance is better than 0, but in the long term, not sure how good will be.

I got the booster shot back in late October (Pfizer x3). My entire family is boosted, and I live in CA where most of the people in my community are fully vaxxed/boosted. I have gotten back into socializing and even attending large events (for example, I went to a small indoor concert with about \~100 people unmasked, but all of whom vaxxed in order to get in). I am very careful about where I go and who I have direct contact with, but have been relieved since most of the people close to me are boosted, let alone fully vaxxed. My issue is that I have a close friend (who lives/goes to school in AZ), who is **unvaccinated** and will not be getting it. She naturally got covid in late august of this year. It was bound to happen since she is basically clubbing/partying every night over there, and since there aren't any mask/vaccine mandates in AZ, most of everyone in her institution got it. She is visiting CA and wants for us to make plans for a new year's party together (with some of my friends here who are vaxxed/boosted). I am uncomfortable bringing her not only around myself, but around people who have taken precautions like I have to be safe (her reasons for not getting it are incredibly stupid and I don't want to get into it). I initially said yes (since I figured it's safe since I'm boosted), but I am having second thoughts now. This is because it's been 4 months since she got it naturally and studies show that natural immunity wanes quicker than the vaccines and transmission for unvaccinated individuals are much higher compares to vaccinated people.

My university is huge, so if we had similar testing as Cornell, I'm afraid we'd have detected a similar outbreak and gone remote.

We have like 90% of Canadians vaccinated, but the 10% that are not are ruining things for everyone.

You would think that in the past 2 years, our government would focus on increasing our hospital capacity and retaining HCWs.. but they havent. At all. So now with any sort of threat of a new wave, we have to lockdown and implement a bunch of restrictions. They are making an announcement tomorrow regarding increasing travel restrictions.

I prioritize winter vacations every year and the thought of being stuck in Canada for another winter is unbearable. Because Im an essential worker, if they reinforce a quarantine, that takes away my ability to go on vacation. Meanwhile, I think HCWs and other essential workers need a vacation the most. Not to discredit people who WFH, because I know it can be super draining, but at least you can travel whenever because the quarantine doesnt effect your job. 2) My partner is American. Rumour has it that they are going to ban any non-citizens from entering the country. My partner can WFH so we have relied on his flexibility to be able to see each other.

Im on the fence about the booster at this point because as proven now the vaccines wont stop restrictions and panic. This time last year I was so depressed but at least I had the light at the end of the tunnel. I said dont worry the summer will be amazing when were all vaccinated. And it was pretty great. But now were back in the same spot except this time theres no light. The vaccines didnt stop it. It just delayed it. Its just a dark black hole void. It seems only the 4 summer months are the only time wel ever be able to enjoy. I fear that more businesses are going to go under further wrecking the future.

394,rh6ezq,12/15/2021 18:56,"So long story. Me and my family are vaccinated other than my children, and me and my wife were actively discussing their vaccines. We have 3 girls aged 12-10-5. They stayed for 2 days at my sisters house while we did some Christmas shopping this weekend. Sister and her husband are fully vaccinated also. Sister calls Sunday evening to tell me that her husband can't smell or taste. I immediately go get the kids and bring them home. They get tested. She's negative he's positive like we assumed. Monday night the 2 older kids start coughing with no fever. Tuesday they feel like crap so I go get some rapid tests from Walmart. Sure enough they're positive. The 5 year old is completely fine. No symptoms and negative test. As with me and my wife. Right now the 10 year old is getting hit the hardest with fever. We've been rotating Tylenol and motrin every 3 to 4 hours per her pediatrician and she's still coughing quite a bit and saying her belly is hurting some. Same with the 12 year old but her fever is only a low grade one. They're really good kids and decided it would be best if they quarantined to their room and wore a mask when they had to come out so they don't get their little sister sick. I've struggled this entire pandemic to keep their lives as normal as possible while still trying to keep them safe and I'm feeling like a massive failure right now. I guess I'm just looking for some reassurance that they're going to be fine. Like I know that they will it's just hard to keep my mind from racing.
