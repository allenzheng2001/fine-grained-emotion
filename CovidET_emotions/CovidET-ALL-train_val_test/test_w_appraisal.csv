Add that to all the Israelis who have attained natural immunity from the virus, and the percentage rate of immunity within Israel arrives at roughly 66%. For a group to have herd immunity to COVID-19, 70% must be immune. Because Israel has yet to achieve herd immunity, it is still possible for an outbreak to take place. Even with this in mind, the outbreak Israel has been facing is minuscule compared to the size of outbreaks at any point in 2020. Additionally, many of the people infected are kids, of whom the Israeli medical establishment has only vaccinated a small amount.","{'Annotation 0 | Assignment ID = 3ZAZR5XV0BTZ9WJD2D2OFKNDGSLZCE | Worker ID = AM6H40LNWSFYA': [{'Emotion': 'anger', 'Abstractive': ""I'm a little frustrated with people spreading fear and pessimism when it's not based on fact.

Two weeks after my initial reactivation, my symptoms begin to subside. I decide to get the first Covid vaccine (I read that in some ""vaccine vanguard"" countries like Israel, they were recommending one covid shot for those who had already had the virus). I get the first shot, and feel a little not great for about 48 hours or so (mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some fatigue, weakness), but afterwards I begin to feel great, better than I had at any point since before I got Covid in early May.

I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year. Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic hit, but then, after 15 months of slow, grinding lockdowns, endless bad news on top of bad news, and nowhere to go to get away from it... Is it really a wonder why everyone is so unhappy all the time? I feel like a machine that's trying harder and harder to run without lubricant, to the point that it's just scraping metal-on-metal, and every day is a bit harder than the last. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to keep this up. The possibility of a variant wave in the Fall, forcing us back into yet another lockdown, terrifies me. I can't relax, I can't focus, and it's been seven or eight months since I've had any meaningful hope for the future. This late in the game, I just... can't shake the feeling that things will never get better. 2019 was the best things will ever be in my lifetime, and it's all downhill from here.","{'Annotation 0 | Assignment ID = 3RWE2M8QWRLLYFAEN9YAPWE3XPGN0S | Worker ID = AM6H40LNWSFYA': [{'Emotion': 'disgust', 'Abstractive': ""I feel so drained from the pandemic that I don't have any energy left to go on with this.

So basically there was this ""construction technology"" course in high school available for ONLY grades 9 and 10. Basically, it's fun and cool stuff like woodshop, building electronics, etc. So I signed up for that class for both Grade 9 and 10. Well, since my school has a semester system I got this course in Semester 2, which amazingly began at the beginning of March 2020. So boom, couldn't do this course. Then in Grade 10 we had this ""hybrid"" model of learning, some days virtual education some days in-person education. Well, due to my school being concerned about the tools having germs on them, the course was cancelled. Now, as of September 2021, I'm in Grade 11. I amazingly had this course at the exact wrong time. I contacted my school to allow me to take this course this year but they didn't make an exception.
