There's no boardwalk and the beach isn't packed. It's a family atmosphere. It's just me and my wife and 2 kids.

I also forgot to bring my receipt to the tailor, so I had to go back home after grocery shopping just to pick it up and deliver it to her to pick my trimmed down pants. And now I feel like I'm spreading COVID-19 to my parents, despite myself getting vaccinated against it. Like, I know the best I'm going to experience is mild symptoms anytime I *do* get it, plus my parents are vaccinated as well, so either they'll experience mild symptoms or no symptoms at all any time I spread it to them. But COVID-19 has the potential to mutate and thus evade our immune systems much more easily.

My siblings are also around as well as my nephews and nieces. However as I am on the train home I'm starting to deeply regret my decision. Yesterday we had a big argument because I suggested that we should do those quick self tests just to feel a little bit more safe. They are all vaccinated, but me being only 24 did not have the chance to get it yet (this is Portugal by the way, I know in the US for instance I could already get my vaccine). Anyway, they basically disagree said that they are safe now so they would not have any care, and go out and won't get tested. I've tried to reason explaining that I am still unvaccinated amd therefore at higher risk than them, and would be more comfortable of we still were a bit careful. I am not asking them to get tested every day, I plan to test myself very 4 days or so but would be fine if they did it once a week or so (doing what 2 tests in total while I am there). I'm feeling terrified, they say that I am being selfish for trying to impose some rules, but I am just trying to protect myself, I am absolutely terrified of getting Covid, and have been able to resist all this time and want to continue to do so.

103,oymahv,8/5/2021 16:41,"Hi Everyone! I'm having a hard time making a decision and was hoping for some more objective input. The short version is that my partner and I are both fully vaxxed but also both ""high risk"". Before Delta showed up in the US we booked a trip to a Florida beach with our also vaxxed but not high risk friends. At the time I had no concerns about the trip at all. But now I'm looking at the news in Florida and am starting to have concerns about the trip. We'd be going a few weeks after schools opened and it looks like hospitals are already filling. My partner works (fully masked) with the public, so I know we could already catch Delta at any time, but I am worried about catching it a 14 hour drive from home and in a place with very limited medical support. We also have very limited funds and really couldn't afford to extend our stay in the case that we got too sick to make the drive back up. We also really can't afford to have my partner take a week off from work and then take off another 10 days if we ended up exposed. I don't want to disappoint my friends though who already asked weeks ago to promise that we would go on the trip no matter what happened with Delta.

119,oz92ut,8/6/2021 15:35,"Last week I saw a tweet from Jack Posobiec that the White House is coordinating with blue states to do a new lockdown during the second week in August: [url] Since he was the only one saying this and all logic pointed to it not happening, I didn't pay it much mind. But ever since then, chatter has gradually increased about this, and Jack has doubled down on his claims: [url] Alex Jones' latest show has now put a date on it: August 11. And if you search ""august 11 lockdown"" or ""biden lockdown"" on Twitter, an increasing amount of people are talking about it.

121,ozdv1m,8/6/2021 19:36,So when the pandemic first struck just like a good amount of people I PANICKED and went full crazy OCD mode. Now Ive had ocd before this and ever since this started it got so terrible. Honestly bless my wife for putting up with me. I went the whole 9 yards with the disinfecting and not touching anything and If somebody including me would touch something or mess up the routine of coming home all hell would break loose with me. Part of the reason it got so bad was because we have a son who was 1 at the time and is now 2 1/2 and I dont ever want him to get this virus. So of course if i can do anything to prevent that I will. Fast forward now and i am completely different thankfully. Although I gotta say there are still quite some things that I wish I could let go. One of those is showering. I take a whole hr washing every body part for like 20 seconds multiple times. On top of that I constantly wash my hands repeatedly after touching a dirty part of my body that hasnt been cleaned yet. This also because I go to the gym so I psych myself out. I always end my showers with cleaning the inside of the shower including the handles as a just in case as well. Even when I come home I take my clothes off then proceed to spray alcohol where I took them off. I really wanna stop. I know transmission through touch is very rare but my OCD is getting to me still.

I am now fully vaccinated with Biontech (I got my second shot on 24.07) and I want to hang out with friends again. My BF's cousin invited me to drink at his house. In total there would be four people (me, my bf, his cousin and his girlfriend). Everyone is fully vaccinated. Up until now, I have only stood in front of people with my FFP2 mask. I try to be less worried but I don't really have the guts to take it off unless I'm outside and no one's in sight.. I've met my BF a couple of times outside after I got my second shot but we both kept our masks on at all times. So, I really want to ask if it is safe to see people without masks when everyone is fully vaccinated. I am 23F and I have asthma and rheumatoid Arthritis. The one person who worries me in my family is my mom. She has diabetes, hypertension, hashimoto's, liver disease etc. She is in her early 50s. She is fully vaccinated with Moderna. (Everyone else is my family is vaccinated too btw) I live with her, so if I do catch COVID despite being vaccinated, I am afraid I would pass it onto her. Alternatively, I also thought about isolating myself for some time after my hangout. I would be fine wearing a mask around my family for 1-2 weeks. I get tested regularly anyways (once a week) so there's that, too. Sorry if this seems paranoid, I just wanna be on the safe side.

Most of the time food has a bland burned-ish type of smell. As for taste, it isnt there at all. I can tell the difference between salty and sweet food. I can also tell some food have a different pattern than others. For example beans have a very strong and ""yummy"" texture. But I cant taste them at all. I never lost my appetite though. I still eat like I normally would. The feeling that my favorite foods leave in my mouth I think is what make them still enjoyable. And also I have always been a ""eat to live"" and not ""live to eat"" type of person so that also helped.",3NXNZ5RS1BWIQKYLUQX7SQ1SW0J79Y,A345TDMHP3DQ3G,['na'],,,,3TXMY6UCAFNUU0A329G4U7JV8K8QC9,AKA8TN8H8DQ6T,['anticipation'],['anticipation'],"[""i was wondering is there anyone out there with the same experience? <sep> i have read myriads of people's comments saying how they got it back in a matter of days or weeks max a few months.""]",['i am expecting someone to share their experience about getting back to normal after getting covid'],"['anticipation', 'na']",['anticipation'],"[0, 4]","[(4, 1)]"

Im 21 and have already had COVID a few months ago. My whole family are vaccinated but I just really really am wary about it. Im not a conspiracy nut, Im a left wing socialist student who is usually on the ""left"" for many many issues. The two things about this vaccine that gets me is that there have been no long term trials and the censorship coming from the pharmaceuticals . Firstly, my anxiety about the long term trials comes from all the previous drugs that failed on mass as a result of improper testing (thalidomide for example). Secondly, I *really* dont like that the pharmaceutical companies that made the vaccines included no liability clauses in their contracts w/ the gov, and they have made BILLIONS- why would they want to admit the vaccine didnt work even if we saw hundreds of adverse reactions? I feel like there is no transparency and I just dont trust them to let us know if it does go wrong. Ive always been wary of big business and this is the first thing I thought when the vaccine was created last year and I just havent been able to think differently on this issue Thats literally all I think.

171,p2em3u,8/11/2021 14:52,"Hey all. Looking for some support or advice/just wanting to vent. My family has faired fairly well throughout this pandemic, navigating it with little difficulty. I'd worked from home since long before the world went remote and my wife has been a stay at home mom for our 4 year old since her birth. We're very much homebodies, so the lockdowns and such weren't a huge departure from the life we'd been leading prior. That's all changed with the school year quickly approaching. We'd initially planned on sending our daughter to Pre-K last year but opted not to because of our concerns about the virus. With an October birthday she's going to be one of the older kids in class this year and she is severely overdue for the type of social interaction that school provides. Anyway, sending unvaccinated kids back to school with the more transmissible Delta Variant being prevalent seems like a recipe for disaster to me. However, I don't think my kid can afford to be isolated another year. We're in a city where Pre-K is provided through the public school system on a first come first serve basis, so, pulling her and reenrolling her later in the semester once vaccinations are available for children under 12 isn't an option. On the plus side, masks are required but its a full-day class, so the kids have to remove those for breakfast and lunch. Anyway, I'm just at a loss for what to do and it disgusts me that we're still in this situation. At this point, my daughter would be absolutely heartbroken if we pulled her out of school but I'd much rather her heartbroken than suffer any longterm effects (or severe effects) of COVID.

Researchers found vaccination coverage rate was inversely correlated to the mutation frequency of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in 16 countries of 20 countries studied and discovered Delta variants evolved differently under the positive selection pressure in the United Kingdom and India.

I'm not a conspiracy theorist, I genuinely don't know the answer to this. I'm looking for some advice. As the title says, I'm 23 and do not really have any health issues. I ask this question humbly and am at this point looking for some reassurance that I am doing the right thing by agreeing to take the vaccine. I'm scheduled to take it in a few days, I don't know which one I'll be taking (here in my country for some reason they did not let me know which one I'll be given). I don't know what difference it makes which one I'll be taking. I have distanced myself from all the news and am not well informed at all about all the different types of vaccines. It's not a smart thing to do on my part but I've had a tough year and it was the last thing on my mind. I've heard some people say that at my age it's not worth it to take the vaccine because the benefits of not catching a virus that would likely not do much harm to me to begin with is overshadowed by any potential side effects that the vaccine could cause. Is this true? Am I just overthinking this? Could there be any long term side effects from any of these vaccines, or will it really most likely not impact my life in any way other than just maybe getting sick for a couple of days after taking the vaccine (which has happened to some people I know)?

I feel like Ive been mostly very lucky with how my family takes Covid seriously, but Im just at my emotional wits end trying to explain something that seems like it should be obvious. Theyre interpreting the numbers in a way that tries to make an incorrect point about how vaccines dont change your chance of surviving Covid once youve been admitted to the hospital. I feel like Im on crazy pills and dont know how to explain it to them in a way that doesnt make me want to pull my hair out. Theyre looking at the rates of hospitalization and deaths in each state, per 100,000, for fully vaccinated vs. unvaccinated people. Theyre looking at data reported by the NYTimes which was updated 3 days ago. So for example, California, where we live, has reported 647 hospitalizations and 58 deaths for unvaccinated people, and 9 hospitalizations and 1 death for vaccinated people. Now, theyre calculating that 58/647= .089, and 1/9= .11, so you have a higher chance of dying in the hospital from Covid if youre vaccinated (instead of realizing that this data really means you are 58X more likely to die of Covid if youre unvaccinated in CA). Basically theyre saying the vaccine doesnt work to help people who are already hospitalized because you have a higher rate of dying in the hospital if youre vaccinated. This data may be *technically* correct, but its missing the context of the fact that the vaccine keeps people out of the hospital in the first place so one person out of nine dying skews the number outrageously.

I'm hopeful that by the end of the Delta wave in the U.S., enough people will have been inoculated one way or another to prevent another widespread surge. My only concern is the potential emergence of a more vaccine-resistant variant, but I doubt there will be one that completely bypasses the vaccines, due to how the vaccines are formulated.

Countrywise, 75% of all adults have received at least one dose and this number is still growing, as the rollout is now focused on young adults (18-25) who werent eligible to get their jab before. While this might seem a vaccine success story, it did not come without its hurdles. Vaccine rollout has been dramatic, to say the least. Bolsonaro is an anti-vaccine apologist and has sabotaged vaccine purchases since they first came. Being the 2nd worst affected country in the world, with over 500k dead, didnt change his heart. In stark contrast to other national leaders on the world, he did not get his jab and does not plan to do so. Skepticism and politicization of vaccines soon struck. We are screwed, I thought. Bolsonaro supporters, which number at least 20-30% of our population, would follow their leader and sabotage vaccination efforts, just like it happens in the US. Young people werent likely to get their jab this year. But somehow, it happened. Despite being disdained by the federal government, vaccines were soon became a representation of hope, soon became something the people needed to fight for if we were to have any chance against this disease. Little by little, Brazilian social media feeds were flooded with pics and videos of people being vaccinated. They put on their best clothes, posting their photos with inspiring takes on the importance of vaccines on Instagram. There is even a joke running here this vaccine only works if you post about it on social media This kind of good and organic peer pressure paid off - upon seeing their friends and relatives getting their jab, most Bolsonaro supporters reluctantly jumped in line to get their jab, even those people would avoid being excluded by their families. Against all odds, we are making it. We dont have many fully vaccinated people yet (just 30% of adult population). Peer pressure and social media work wonders.

I canceled several in-person meetings this week, the most important of which being with my thesis advisor who has a 10 year old son. I told him what happened and that I thought we should postpone, and he suggested we met Friday morning, of course pending a negative test result. The new CDC guidelines say that you should get tested 3-5 days after exposure, so my question is, if I test Thursday morning (roughly 4 and 1/2 days after potential exposure) is that long enough to really trust a negative result, or should I wait, push back with my professor, and self-isolate for longer?

In my country of residence, vaccination was very slow, but in my other country of citizenship, vaccines were widely available. I received my first vaccine dose in the country of residence, but the second dose was not to be available for another 3 months. During this period, a close family member in my other country of citizenship became very ill, and I needed to get there immediately. Additionally, in order to be able to see her, because of strict rules, I needed to be fully vaccinated. And so, I took my second vaccine there, and the physician accepted the proof of my first vaccine from my residence country. It was the best decision, because I was able to spend an entire month with my family member, and left feeling at least somewhat less heavy-hearted. The problems is that my residence country will *not* accept my vaccination record from the other country, and so I am officially ""not fully vaccinated."" What this means is that I cannot be granted the current ""Vaccination Passport"" available to all residents, which allows those fully vaccinated to travel to all other EU countries without quarantine, testing, or other problems. Without this, traveling - which I need to do for my work - will become extremely difficult, often impossible. So I'm thinking of just going to get my ""second"" vaccine here in my country of residence, which is now available, and then the authorities will issue the passport so that I can get on with my life as much as possible.

My uncle had to literally drag him to the hospital because he refused to get help. He knew he had covid and wouldn't admit it, putting not only himself but my 84 year old grandma and my two uncles in danger. One of them (the one who ended up dragging him to the ER) has fybromialgia, so his health is also incredibly compromised because of that. Yet he risked his life for my dad. Luckily, no one else ended up as bad as he is right now because they all got vaccinated back in the day, and only got infected but had very few symptoms. As far as the situation with my dad goes, doctors have been honest with us, and although it is not impossible for my dad to get out of this, he's in a very very critical state. Because of this, I've barely been able to eat or sleep, anxiety is eating me alive and I've started to notice how this is affecting my moods. I can barely get a hold of myself. I'm extremely angry and sad and resentful and tired. All at the same time. I've started to snap at people, and I have the constant need to scream until my throat breaks.

They just asked me to confirm if I will attend the wedding as a bridesmaid.

I live with my parents, one of whom has had historic lung issues, is 71, and also probably high risk. We're all fully vaccinated. My goal, really, throughout all this is to reduce my chance of *infection* to near zero. It's hard to imagine an infection, even asymptomatic, couldn't pose a serious threat for my parents, much less the terrifying risk of long covid. I know being vaccinated my chances of hospitalization and death are low, that's not really what I'm worried about. I'm a wind player, and theoretically have an orchestra concert coming up mid september. I'm in Oregon where cases are pretty out of control. From what research I've seen, playing a wind instrument is essentially identical to just talking in terms of risk factor. So that's fine. Assuming no precautions are taken, that'll be something like 20 people within 15 feet of me, possibly unvaccinated, unmasked, not particularly well ventilated space, for multiple hours. To me that is very clearly an untenable risk, even though I am vaccinated. I guess the first gut check - am I already being over-cautious in thinking that? If I'm right that that is way too risky. What precautions would be reasonable to ask for? If everyone is vaccinated, all non-wind players are masked, and I'm 6 feet away from everyone else, that's about as many mitigating factors as possible - and I honestly can't tell if that's enough to be safe or not.

I had heard that it was typically recommended to chemo patients, as the treatments can destroy your smell and taste in a similar way that Covid does. I lost my smell and taste in Nov of last year, and it's been very difficult to deal with ever since. You should be able to find it at Walmart or Walgreens, and most pharmacies should carry them. You don't need a prescription to buy them, either. I personally have been taking it for about a week now, and I have noticed some changes. My smell isn't totally back, but I can tell that it's improving. I'm wondering if I'll have to take a stinger dose seeing as it's been so long. We'll just have to wait and see. Just wanted to share with others currently struggling to find something to help. If you Google alpha lipoic acid, the first thing that comes up is smell loss do due upper respiratory infections.

However, the wedding will be attended by 100+ people from all over the country and other countries.

Their plan is to have ""spaced seating"" and ""strongly suggest"" that people be vaccinated and have everyone wear masks. If there's anything this pandemic has taught us, it is that people will lie and do whatever they want to. Of course the proof can be faked, but it's still better than nothing.

While I wanted to get it and was eligible months ago, I wasn't allowed. They seemed so very genuinely worried that it would hurt me, and it was emotionally taxing to keep arguing against them. They wouldn't listen. Since I don't leave the house much, I figured it would be okay to give up. I agreed to wait until FDA approval, then get it. In a case of the worst possible timing ever, though, just as a vaccine receives full approval, there's been an outbreak at my father's workplace. A big one.

407,pejaxy,8/30/2021 14:33,"Maybe I'm being overly cautious, however, I've had a long weekend trip planned with some friends for a few months. One of my good buddies just informed the group chat last night that he tested positive for Covid four days ago (Thursday), and showed flu-like symptoms at the beginning of the week (Monday). He said that he is feeling better, and by the time we leave for the trip, which is this Thursday it will be 10 days he's been in isolation and according to the CDC, he should be cleared to resocialize and therefore not miss the trip. I know there are a lot of factors and it's hard to determine when it might be safe to be around others, but that time frame still seems very tight. For the record, everyone in our party is fully vaccinated, so there is some protection. But we will be in tight quarters for a few days, and I'll be in close contact with family for some time after this trip. We are all getting tested, and he said he will as well. There is a light understanding that if he tests positive that he won't go, but he has been kind of forward stating that there is a high probability he will even if he is ""Not Contagious"". Which makes me feel like he might try to attend regardless. The fact that it's a breakthrough infection is making me feel a little overly cautious about wanting to attend.

Apparently he got it at school after they started a week ago. He got tested today as the school had been getting reports on several other students testing positive. He had his confirmation yesterday and I as well as other family members were present. Which has me a bit worried (My family and importantly my grandparents who were there are fully vaccinated) yet I am still worried, especially for my brother. I am worried he will feel like this is his fault. The whole situation is just really stressful. I live in another city and traveled home last night (wearing a mask and keeping my distance to other people) but I am still worried about having spread the virus as I took a train home. I have scheduled a test for myself tomorrow and am really hoping I test negative. I live quite far away and they are swamped with informing the rest of the attendees about how to proceed. Luckily most of the guests (with the exception of three teenagers) were vaccinated. There weren't that many guests though just 13 - 15. However I just feel stressed and worried about this whole affair.

I got my first dose of Pfizer back in May &amp; ended up getting really bad joint pain that continues to persist. After doing research, I realized that lots of people have had similar problems &amp; worse (heart inflammation, etc). Eventually, I got really anxious and didnt end up getting my second dose. Even though I mask up when I do go out and social distance as much as possible, I still fear that Ill catch covid. Since the delta variant lowers the efficacy of the vaccines, I can imagine how much less protection I have being partially vaccinated. I fear for not only myself, but my mother &amp; other family members. Most of my friends are not vaccinated &amp; are also skeptical of the vaccine. One of my friends sisters has gotten 2 doses &amp; she developed myocarditis and experienced issues with her period. I know not everyone will have the same experience, but whos to say who will and who wont ? Covid isnt any better either. Lots of people made me feel crazy for getting the vaccine; I was super excited to get it but now Im terrified. Has anyone gone through the same thing?

I then tested my niece who was vaccinated in June, and to my surprise, she was positive (also Pfizer.) Ater this, I decided to get vaccinated, again.

Have they just not defined these categories yet? Do we have any information on what those definitions will be? Will they be left up to the states like in the first role out? Because 'at increased risk' could mean a very small number, or it could mean anyone with any of the preexisting comorbidities from back in last winter (which was defined state by state). Are we looking at a narrow definition - like decreased lung function or previous heart attack - or a broad one, like high blood pressure and obesity? Or is there not enough information to say?

I'm disappointed because I build up this image in my head of the vaccine as a COVID shield that makes you really resistant to COVID and that it's super hard to get infected with it. I was even reading a case of a doctor who had the Pfizer vaccine who spent hours next to COVID patients and the doctor never got COVID. Now that I have it I feel extremely let down especially because I did try to take all the precautionary measure I possibly could. In the end I feel like having the vaccine made no difference to our family being infected because we got it anyways.

617,pyttfu,9/30/2021 21:53,"So last friday, my mom got a bit sick. We weren't really worried, since she has the best immune system out of all the family members, although she has been badly sick around 4-5 times ever since I'm alive, and I'm 20. To be honest I can't imagine someone being healthier than her. At 47, I wouldn't consider her to be old, she doesn't drink or smoke, she is fit, no heart problems, no diabetes, basically nothing that would put her at higher risk. She started having a dry cough and a fever, so I suggested that she should go get tested and she did 2 days ago. It came back positive. This was quite possibly my worst fear, since she never got vaccinated. She isn't antivax or anything like that, me and my sister got all the neccessary vaccinations children get, it's just about how quickly the covid vaccine was made. Or so she said. So today, she was in the worst condition I have ever seen her in. She didn't really have a fever during the day. Only a terrible headache, a burning stomach, and a burning chest. No shortness of breath or anything like that. Obviously her strength is close to zero, but that's really common, so I was not really worried about that. Now that it's around midnight, her fever came back, so I gave her some painkillers and she is now sleeping. I would greatly appreciate some tips on how to make her feel better, since I'm really worried about her. I really really don't want her to have any complications.

630,rhywoy,12/16/2021 20:04,"So the past few months I've been doing well and avoided Reddit and other Covid news, and my mental health improved during that time, but since news broke about Omicron, my Reddit/doomscrolling obsession came back full force. I feel like my mental health is going down the drain, but I just couldn't stop sometimes. The reason I couldn't stop sometimes is because I have this irrational fear that if I stopped, I'd just be putting my head in the sand and falling into a delusional slumber, and I won't be ""awake"" to the threat on the horizon. The past few days have been rough. There's been so many times I was reading a news article or a Reddit thread and felt tears welling up in my eyes, but could not stop as my irrational mind feared I'd then fall into a delusional slumber. I am literally destroying my mental health for the sake of staying ""awake"". I need to stop. But I'm starting to notice that whenever I'm browsing Reddit, the most reassuring things I see are updates from well-established Twitter experts that do a good job of describing the situation in a balanced manner (e.g. Cyrus Shahpar with the vaccination updates and Chise with the Omicron updates). Because of this, I'm deciding that a better approach may be to just refer to well-established experts in order to stay up to date on Covid. It's honestly a win-win. I'm not putting my head in the sand, but neither am I doomscrolling and destroying my mental health. So I just want to ask you guys - what are some other good experts that you recommend getting information from?

But I took a chance and went to see a band months ago in a small venue once I'd been fully vaccinated. Literally counted less than 60 people in a hall that normally houses 600-700. Double masked, sanitized, the whole bit. Then this week... I researched this place, same size as the other venue. Concert wasn't sold out, looked like plenty of room, good ventilation and the band insisted on masks. The venue ignored the mask rule. Absolutely packed the place. The second band (which was horrible btw) kept encouraging crowd surfing and moshing and it went nuts. But by this time...I've invested 5 hours into this. I think it will be over in a few songs and I don't know that any of these people even want to be around for the actual headliner. But it went on and on. And then the headliner comes on. They are clearly annoyed with the venue but they too encourage ""the energy"" (paraphrasing) and do nothing to stop this. It is stifling, even when I move back from it all.

Im double vaxxed and got my booster last week, but Im not a healthy woman. (76lbs underweight and anemic) When I get sick, I get *siiiick*. I was also recently taken off my parents health insurance, so if I get a particularly bad case of Rona, Ill just have to die because Ill never be able to afford hospitalization. Luckily, Gamestop has taken *some* precautions. My store has a Masks STRONGLY recommended sign on the door, but only the employees actually wear masks. Theres also a hand sanitizer dispenser by the door. Theres no bag in it, so its useless, but the thought is there. Im a few days into this job, and Ive probably been within three feet of three-hundred people without masks on. Maskless kids are common, coughing without covering their mouths then touching the displays. I have to take used games and consoles from strangers who might have kept them in a house with five sick individuals for all I know. Its terrifying. I cant NOT work. I have $34.01 in my bank account, and I still havent gotten Christmas gifts for my family (which they are VERY vocal about expecting, but thats a vent post for another subreddit). I know I have to work, but its getting really, really hard to convince myself to show up and actually *risk my life* for $9/hr. Im scheduled for forty more hours this week, which Im thankful for because hooray money, but horrified at the potential consequences. I just want someone to tell me my fears are valid and that Im not a weenie for being worried about my situation.

My father and I are both fully vaccinated but the rest of our family is not. I am wondering what to do if my father or I gets COVID while we are out of state. I would ideally like to drive back home (a 5 hour trip) in the event either of us get sick but am not sure if it would be better/safer to instead bring my father for treatment immediately (while out of state) instead of driving five hours back home to bring him to his own local hospital. I know it is imperative to receive immediate treatment when a person is high risk so am concerned about making the long trip home. If I get COVID and my father does not, my sibling doesn't have enough space to self isolate so I could not stay at the house and would have to drive home. The problem is with this scenario is that my father would need to come with me (I am his caretaker) but I would be worried sick that he would get COVID from me on the long five hour drive back home.

711,rljemc,12/21/2021 17:19,"Hey everyone, really looking for some support as this situation is really weighing me down mentally. Yesterday afternoon and into today I started experiencing mild cold symptoms (tickle in throat, very slight cough and very slight stuffy nose). Naturally, I'm panicking because, while it is cold season, I'm fearing that I have COVID, and the timing could not be worse. Not only am I supposed to see my family during the holiday, I also went to a couple holiday parties over the weekend. &amp;#x200B; I had COVID in January and I am fully vaccinated, but have not yet received my booster. I am 28 years old. I am planning on getting tested today. While worrying that I will miss the opportunity to see my family over Christmas is hard enough, if I test positive I would need to tell everyone I saw at work yesterday and over the weekend that I tested positive, and they would then need to get tested and potentially ruin their holidays. I would feel like such an awful person and that all of my friends and colleagues would see me as the one who ruined their Christmas. I really hope it's just a cold, but last time I thought I had a cold I got tested and wound up with COVID. I know this might sound selfish but I almost considered not getting tested just so I wouldn't know if I had it or not, but I know the moral thing to do is find out. Everyone I was at the parties with is vaccinated so hopefully they are okay if I test positive. &amp;#x200B; Am I doing the right thing? What if I had it a month ago and didn't notice, and I test positive because of the antibody and it's just a cold masquerading as COVID symptoms?

Since then, shes become pretty sick. I spent quite a bit of time with her on Monday and Tuesday - unmasked. Not only are we co-workers but were also sort of buddies. I immediately tested on Tuesday and came back negative. However, if I was exposed to her on Monday or Tuesday, then it most likely wouldnt show up. I am getting tested again tonight (Thursday). However, I have a flight out tomorrow to visit my parents for the week. My parents are in their early to mid 60s. They are in good health, except my mom isnt vaccinated. I am now faced with this situation where I could potentially test positive here in the next couple of days. I dont want to risk it to my parents but they say they dont care, its worth the risk to them. I told them thats not the point, you may not care but if something happens I will be the one to deal with it.

We're still here, however close we are to losing our minds, and that's something that's so significant. We've fought our minds and won. Plenty of us (absolutely me included) will be having waves of hopelessness and fear that come and go and recede a little then rear up again and smack us one. And that's alright - what we've been through would definitely class as trauma, especially if you've had difficult circumstances, personal encounters with COVID, or supportive interactions cancelled. We shouldn't expect to feel unscathed after all of that. But no matter how hard it gets, try to remember that there's been plenty of positive studies released about the current situation (which yes, we know they have caveats, but their presence is an amazing positive compared to their absence). Also remember that absolutely everything in life is temporary - you won't feel this way forever. (And even if you don't believe it right now, it's still going to be true regardless.) I know this Christmas will be difficult - bad times can be amplified when you feel like you should be feeling good. But if you can, try to step away from the news for a while (all the stories will still be there when you get back) and do something that makes you happy or switch off from the world - eat good food, talk to someone, play a video game, sleep for twelve hours. Don't be afraid to mope or cry or pretend it's not the holidays, either. But either way, you're gonna get through Christmas, and you're gonna get through the next few months of COVID, and then you're gonna get through whatever comes next, and you'll look back and realise you're so far in the future away from your worst moments and it'll feel like no time has passed at all.

He says it helps with his grief which I totally understand. He works as a massage therapist which scares the hell out of me. He's in a small room with a client for 2 hours at a time up-close since that's how massages tend to be. He agreed to suspend his practice in January because of the surge in cases but he's still going to see clients this coming week.

Every time I see a ""positive"" headline or news story they always throw in the ""except for those over 65"". I'm not worried about myself, I'm worried about him!

I think he may have been exposed before the trip (between 12/9-12/13). Some of the people he was working with tested positive while we were on our trip. Does that timeline sound about right for him to start experiencing symptoms starting 12/24? He woke up Christmas Eve and felt awful full on symptoms of what I thought to be the flu but with a negative COVID test. The next day, he tested twice both with super faint positive lines. 12/26, the positive line was darker. The only other time he would have been exposed was 12/22 when he was with someone that texted and told him they tested positive. But Im not sure if the onset of the symptoms would have happened that quickly. I guess my real question here is: Has anyone gotten COVID (tested positive and everything) and then gotten a negative test within a few days? Also, has anyone experience getting a false positive test OR anyone know if you can test positive even if its just the flu? I took a test and was negative and am feeling fine. I was sure it was just the flu because I am vaccinated against it and hes not. Lastly, and I know this is a dumb question so dont attack me How soon after he tests negative can I go see him? Were both kind of hoping/holding out for him to be negative by NYE. Super selfish, again, dont attack me. Its just wishful thinking and Im just trying to understand a timeline and hear other peoples experiences. Im curious to know if anyone has gotten over it in a shorter amount of time than others. Hes healthy otherwise and vaccinated (which I know means little at this point). Once he tests negative (even if before the recommended 10 days), if I go see him, is there still a huge risk? \*\*His symptoms as of now are: on and off fever, fatigue, GI upset (he threw up once and has had weird stomach stuff sometimes otherwise), stuffy nose (new), cough with green phlegm (getting better), headache, body aches he actually looks and sounds good for being sick.

Of course, it is impossible to get into a hospital or doctor's office right now.

887,ru1i4f,1/2/2022 4:27,"Sorry in advance for the long post. Im just seeking some insight on the use of oxygen at home after Covid and how long most people need it. About 3 weeks ago my husband (m31) tested positive for Covid. He was very low on energy and slept ALOT for about a week. Finally, we noticed his oxygen saturation was dropping off and on. On day 7 of him being positive, his oxygen saturation dropped to 83. So, we had him sent to the hospital via ambulance. He stayed in the hospital for 8 days. After a day and a half he was bumped from 5 liters of oxygen to a heated high flow 50 liters. He stayed on that for about 3 days and then they slowly decreased. He was discharged about a week ago, but he still has to use oxygen when he sleeps and sometimes throughout the day. His PCP says he needs to stick with it for at least another month. My husband is very determined to stop using it as much and he is pushing himself. I understand he doesnt want to use it forever, but his doctor says it will take one day at a time. I am hopeful that he will be able to come off of it soon, but I fear that my husband is rushing it.

And now I'm so scared I will have to do the same, but still trying to be positive and manifest a good outcome. The day before Christmas, my own dad tested positive for covid, had typical cold symptoms, said he felt fine otherwise. I bought him an oximeter and yesterday he started feeling worse and his blood oxygen level was at 42% so I brought him to the hospital. He called me and sounded so scared and confused and asked me to come pick him up and bring him to the hospital. His healthcare team said it's an extreme case of covid and there is a high probability that he may be intubated. If he maxes out on the oxygen through his cannula, he will move to CPAP, and then to a vent. The doctor said he's now at a point where patients typically start to gradually improve, or take a sharp decline and have to end up on a vent, which has a 50% mortality rate for my dad's age. Thankfully his oxygen level is staying above 90% while he's got the cannula in and is thinking more clearly, etc. It could really go either way right now. I can't go see him, he can't really talk on the phone, I couldn't even wait with him in the ER waiting room. Just had to hug him real quick, tell him I love him, and then leave.

I tested positive on Dec 14th, 20 days ago. After being cleared by my university on the 24th, I went to Europe to meet my family after a negative antigen from CVS. I lived my life like I had no fear of getting it anytime soon; nothing crazy just went to a small bar a couple of nights. Come Jan 1st, and I wake up with a slightly stuffy nose. Later that night, my sister, who I spent every second of the trip, tested positive for covid. After that moment I became extremely worried that my congestion was covid and it only got worse with flying back. I tested on the 2nd after my flight and my antigen came back positive. I freaked out.

Immediately upon finding this out i took a rapid test and it was negative, and then today i took a PCR and am waiting for results. My mother with whom i'm staying with is severely immunocompromised (like had open heart surgery a year ago and one of her lungs doesnt work properly). So despite having been in in very close contact with her i am now distancing from her and everyone else in the house and wearing a mask. Then, today we discovered that a family member who was here on the 1st just tested positive on a rapid test today. So, i have a couple of questions cause we're all kind of freaking out right now. 1) How likely is it that i have covid right now (from the person i was with on the 29th)? 2) It is even possible for me to have transmitted covid to this family member who was here on the first? If i was carrying it, my time of contact with the virus would have been only 4 days prior. Is this enough time for me to have then transmitted it to someone else? 3) What exactly is safe to do in my house? Right now i am confining myself to either my bedroom (mask off) or in an adjacent bonus room (with a mask on). This room is fairly large, and a couple of people in the house pass through it a few times a day, generally passing about 15-20 feet away from me. How likely is it that i can pass the virus to them while being in this room, with a mask on? Thanks, appreciate any help i can get. Note: everyone in my family has 2 vaccines, my mother has had 3.

Not knowing if I would have to give birth alone or the hospital would take away my baby. We were in strict lockdown up until my husband and I could be vaccinated. We didn't go inside anywhere. I cried every day last winter. My son is very social and loves people and I couldn't give that to him. He would smile ear to ear at doctor appointments because he could finally see someone that wasn't my husband or me. Over the summer we started doing thing again, it was great. My son was so happy. We did something every day. We would walk around stores, grocery shop, eat out, and go to swim lessons. But it August with delta we started to self lock down again. Back to crying every day and trying to entertain a social toddler. Fast forward to the news that vaccines are actually a long ways away. I lost it mentally. Went full ""fuck it"" mode. Even with the massive surge going on right now. I started doing things again. Going to malls just to walk around with my son, going out to eat, and meeting with friends and family even if they do risky things. I'm pretty sure we haven't gotten sick yet. We all had a cold 3 weeks ago but tested negative on rapid tests so who knows. I'm just defeated. So this is my confession. I'm a bad parent and putting my son at risk.

Schools starting again and I have assignments to do, I'm so hungry, and I need my meds renewed, but all I can think of is how scared I am of being alone. I think I got traumatized by past instances of being alone during lockdown and I emotionally can't do it this time around. There's also a curfew which makes things even worse. I can't even distract myself with TV or movies, I feel no desire to do anything. On top of that many of my friends are suicidal and I'm so so scared that I'll lose someone. I live in Quebec and everything is so fucked, I feel completely trapped and the walls are closing in on me. This cycle of being able to live on my own= there being another lockdown = having a mental breakdown and moving in with my parents = moving back out to the city I normally live in , makes me feel like nothing will ever improve. I have a pet who needs me to care for him but I can't, I'm struggling and I need help. Please if anyone is going through the same thing or knows some tips to cope please help, I feel like I can't breathe and idk how much longer I can do this,",3LRLIPTPER8KQIFA5Q0GSQHYAASKA5,A345TDMHP3DQ3G,"['anticipation', 'fear', 'sadness']","['anticipation', 'fear', 'sadness']","[""i'm pretty sure i have covid and the testing tommorow will likely confirm that."", ""i think i got traumatized by past instances of being alone during lockdown and i emotionally can't do it this time around."", 'this cycle of being able to live on my own= there being another lockdown = having a mental breakdown and moving in with my parents = moving back out to the city i normally live in , makes me feel like nothing will ever improve.']","[""i expect that i have covid and that my test will confirm that since i've spent so much time with my sister, who's tested positive."", ""i'm afraid that i'll test positive for covid since my sister has tested positive and i can't handle the loneliness of being by myself for lockdown."", ""i'm sad because i feel like i'll never be able to break out of my parents' house since i inevitably have to move in with them every time a lockdown makes me have a mental breakdown.""]",31JLPPHS2VT3WO14U3DZCZK1OBMO3L,AKA8TN8H8DQ6T,"['anticipation', 'disgust', 'fear', 'sadness']","['interest', 'disgust', 'terror', 'sadness']","[""please if anyone is going through the same thing or knows some tips to cope please help, i feel like i can't breathe and idk how much longer i can do this,"", 'i live in quebec and everything is so fucked, i feel completely trapped and the walls are closing in on me.', ""and i'm so scared , not as much about being sick but the isolation. <sep> on top of that many of my friends are suicidal and i'm so so scared that i'll lose someone."", ""i think i got traumatized by past instances of being alone during lockdown and i emotionally can't do it this time around.""]","['i am interested to know if any body had same experience and how to deal with it', 'i am disgusted to see the place i am trapped right now', 'i am terrorized about being in isolation rather than having covid  \n\ni am afraid of losing someone as my friends are suicidal', 'i am feeling bit sad about the state i am']","['anticipation', 'disgust', 'fear', 'sadness']","['anticipation', 'disgust', 'fear', 'interest', 'sadness', 'terror']","[1, 4, 6, 7]","[(1, 1), (1, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1)]"

I am not an anti vaxxer, I do believe in science and my kids have all their vaccins up to date. I have concerns that I would like to share so people can help me take a decision. Our government made a vaccin passport and we cannot go to restaurants or do interior activities without it. I consider myself a very responsible citizen and I would like your opinions in a polite manner. I am here to have clearer thoughts. My main concerns are: 1. I dont feel the obligation since we dont have any known health issues and we do not live or work with old people. 2. We all got what we think is covid before tests were available (jan-feb 2020) I had all the symptoms including loss of smell and taste and it was the worst flu of my life. I never got that sick in my entire 35 years. Husband and kids less than me. All my surroundings were very sick. My nurse friend said at the clinic they has lots of unknown cases, doctor couldnt figure out what it was.. and antibiotics didnt work. So many people got it. 3. I wear my mask and keep social distancing and whatever my Quebec (canada) government is asking. Even though I do not follow their logic because of their lack of transparency and open debate. 4. Lots of scientiste, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, are against what is happening and the obligation to get vaccinated. So I do have a trust issue I never get my news from facebook or social media. I do know how to read scholarly articles. 5. Lets not lie about the fact that pharmaceutical companies are getting richer 6. Vaccins have to fo through many years of testings (5-7) so I am scared about long term effect 7. In Israel they started the 4th shot so vaccin is not fixing the problem?! 8.

I go in one day a week...but it's not the same. I don't know half the people now, and the atmosphere which made the job enjoyable has just gone. My role has been changed, and the promised promotion given to somebody else, because I was struggling with the solitude, and spending 90% of my waking hours in one room.

Partly from food, but mainly because I always walked around a lot in the office. Just before Xmas, I crashed badly. I could barely eat, couldn't stop crying, couldn't focus on anything (there was something behind this that I won't go into detail on). I spent the Xmas break at my mom's, and also saw my dad, which lifted me a bit. Now I am back home, I tested positive for covid yesterday, which means at least a week of solitary confinement.

No fever, loss of smell, chills, fatigue, or anything like that. I was double-vaccinated at the time, am now boosted because appointments were hard to snag.

We went through the courts and my brilliant, affectionate, funny, wonderful 13 year old son now lives with me, with only a few days every few weeks at his mom's, which he's actually not quite happy about. As part of the agreement, he spent a few days with her over New Years. He left the 30th and was supposed to come back the 4th. During the night 31st--&gt;1st, he calls me at 2am, panicking: his mom tested positive with a home test for COVID, and he tested negative. The earliest I could pick him back up was the 2nd, and he isolated as much as possible between then and when I could pick him up. Upon returning to my place we were meticulously cautious. He's confined in his room, even for his meals, - he doesn't step outside except to use the washroom which I clean after every use. I try to keep it light, stay - both masked - more than 2m from each other to discuss his homework and read stuff to each other. The days are passing and he remains 100% symptoms free. I'm assuming he was exposed right when he went over there, on the 30th, which would make it day ""1"", and would make today day ""9"", although I'm assuming that the most cautious scenario would be to consider the last contact with her (Jan 2nd) as day ""1"", which would only make today day ""6"".

So, if you've read my previous posts, you'll know my situation of living with antivax parents and how that has affected me mentally speaking. Well, to cut a long story short, I did what you recommended me: I got my shot in secret. Yesterday I got my first dose of Sputnik, and in February I'll try to get the second one. No side effects, apart from pain in the place of the injection. It's been more than 24 hours, so I guess I'm good on that side. It honestly feels surreal. I didn't even plan for it to happen that way, it was a spur of the moment decision. But now something troubles me. I fear my family may get to know it, and I don't feel the same having to hide it from them. I fear I was being impulsive and the best choice was to wait. I try to tell myself I had little choice, with Delta increasing the cases in my town, but it doesn't feel that way.

999,rzcmju,1/8/2022 23:00,"Hello, I tested positive for Covid but still have friends/family that aren't vaccinated. There are so many questions I realized I couldn't answer with certainty when discussing Covid with them. I was hoping to get some help for answers here. 1. If you are vaccinated, are you less likely to spread the virus? For example, if I am vaccinated and my cousin is not, we both meet my uncle who has Covid and are exposed. Since I am vaccinated, is there a higher chance that my body rejects the virus and so I don't become a carrier and spread it to others? If so, how much higher are the odds (if all other things are equal)? 2. If you had Covid previously, do you have a lesser chance of spreading it? Do Covid survivors have some immunity, so when they are exposed to someone with Covid, they have a much lesser chance to becoming a carrier. Since I had Covid AND I am vaccinated, am I much less likely to be a carrier now? Obviously, there are a lot of variables, but these questions are about the general odds. It seems like the narrative is constantly changing so it gets confusing. For example, now the news seems to be saying that even if your vaccinated you're going to get Covid, but you'll have milder symptoms. Or that you can spread it almost as easily as someone who is not vaccinated, etc. It would be great to see some very clear stats -- eg. if you are vaccinated, and you are exposed to someone with Covid, you are 90% less likely to become a carrier and spread it to others -- or something like this.

I started feeling sick this last Tuesday (1/4) at work. Have a chronic cough that got worse and started having bad headaches, muscle aches, congestion, etc. Went home early and got tested Wednesday (1/5). Test came back positive. Doctor told me to come home and self-isolate for at least 10 days since I started feeling sick, so that would be 1/14, since that's when I knew for sure I was feeling sick. I got a doctor's note for work to explain this. Got a call Friday from my boss saying that, due to the new CDC guidelines, the state institution I work for is only requiring five days of quarantine, no need to retest, and that I should be cleared for work this coming Monday (1/10), provided I have improving symptoms. As of right now, other than the occasional cough and some congestion, I'm feeling a lot better, and even those are WAY better than where I was at on Tuesday. Obviously, I want to get back to work, but I'm concerned about how short the quarantine my work is requiring is, when even the doctor was saying I should quarantine for at least 10 days. I, luckily, didn't infect anyone at work, and I'm concerned that I might do so if I return early. Because of the nature of the job, there's a high likelihood that, if I'm still contagious, they'll also get it. Any advice? Should I talk to my boss on Monday, explain the situation, and try to use vacation to cover it? Or should I follow the CDC and my work's guidelines?

1030,s0z2uw,1/11/2022 0:19,"&amp;#x200B; ""Life will never go back to the way it was before Covid19"" has been the rallying cry of the depressing since the pandemic began. It's followed with more doom and gloom theories like the idea that ""masks don't work"" and ""vaccines don't work"", etc. There has been this idea that some Covid was a magical, mysterious new force that could evade all attempts to stop it. But it's not. It's dangerous, sure, but it is just a virus. It isn't ""trying to find a way around our immunity"" or ""going after certain populations"". It isn't waiting for prayers to stop it. It's stupid. It's not even a life-form. It's a piece of biological machinery dependent entirely on the living to do anything at all. It's a gear...not the engine. Masks slow it down, quarantine slow it down more, vaccines much more than that and so on. But to really go back to pre-covid19 days we would need not only vaccines, herd immunity and basic safety measures, but also a way to ""Tamiflu"" the virus if caught in the early days. All these steps together should bring us back to levels and severity more consistent with a typical flu season.

I don't use the microwave and when I take food out of the fridge, I leave it for 30 minutes so at room temperature before eating it. The microwave kills all the nutrients in food. I rarely eat any type of junk food hence why I never get sick! I make sure I get enough sleep every night and well as work out every day and meditate. I have never met one person that lives a healthy life like myself hence why I never get sick. Before 10 years it was a different story cause I had such a poor lifestyle. I've lost my job cause I didn't get the Covid vaccine. Can't do lots of things now cause I've lost my rights BUT if you have Covid, you are excepted for 6 months. You can do what the vaccinated can do (everything) where I can go back to work if I get Covid and travel. 2 of my housemates have Covid where I want to get Covid from them. It's been 2 days where they have been vaccinated but my girlfriend and I have no symptoms still. I shook their hands, let them cough where they shake my hand and I rub it in my face. It's been 2 days and I don't have any symptoms. I want to make sure I get Covid tomorrow where I'm going to get tested in 2 days. How can I make sure I get Covid tomorrow?

We're in a room that's probably about 80sqft, so a small and windowless space. We're both always masked(me with a kn95, her a surgical mask) and vaxxed(I'm also boosted). The reason it's possible is that she had a cold over the winter break that she could never get tested for, but might have been covid and that showed on the PCR. Her rapid test for re-entering school on Monday was negative. She's supposed to take another rapid test on Saturday, so we'll see how that goes. I'm not especially worried for myself. I'm triple vaxxed, 31, and healthy. My dilemma comes from living with my 70 year old mother and 66 year old, diabetic father.

How could it not? The one thing that worries me though is we know that the largest business interests can completely control policy due to their influence on politicians. Regardless of where they are in the political spectrum - right, left or center. So it's safe to say that the oil lobby will want to return to normalcy and they wield a lot of power. They want travel to come back, people to get into their cars and go places, and the manufacturing economy to start chugging along at full speed. Then you have the entities that actually benefit hugely in this pandemic phase: companies like amazon that have obliterated retail and keeping people out of malls only helps their business.

Ive had a few close contacts/exposures over last week and this week, the most recent one being Monday. I have a 6 month old baby so just for piece of mind really, I tested every day since. On Thursday morning I tested using an On/Go rapid test and it came back positive but with a really faint line, faint enough that I had to shine my light on it to see it. Trying not to panic, I wanted to be extra sure so I worked (from home) waited 8 hours and then took the other test out of that same box. This time, the positive line showed up a little more visible but at about minute 7 I noticed that the line was half gone. And by minute 10 it had completely disappeared. Confused and anxious, I took a different brand test (Quidel Quick View) and that came back negative after the ten minutes. I was feeling a little manic that day from all of the confusion and ended up digging that test out of the trash after about an hour and it looked like there was a positive line there, but it wasnt there the first time. Friday morning I tested negative and also Saturday I tested negative.

This may be the sole reason why this variant is the worst one yet. It can infect you no matter what vaccine you got, or how many times youve been vaccinated. An omicron specific vaccine would likely help, but our vaccine makers are too slow right now with this creation, and should have started making it back in November when this was discovered. It evades almost all immunity provided by vaccination. It does not evade T cells, however, and I personally feel we were really lucky we got away scot free with that. Nevertheless even being sick with Covid is not acceptable if youre boosted. 2. Transmissibility: this variant is almost as contagious as measles. You can get it even being masked with a cloth mask next to one other person, outside. To sum it up, this variant nearly brought us back to March 2020.

1108,s5ejz3,1/16/2022 15:49,"So, I'm in my early 60's and a lung cancer survivor. In March of 2020 my PCP suggested that I not work in a retail grocery environment until the scope of Covid was known. After speaking with my manager I was put on Medical Leave of Absence which allowed me to keep and self pay for my healthcare. My wife and I went into hard lockdown. Mostly deliveries of food, although I did do a little shopping at TJ's when they used to have senior hours. Fast forward to June of 2021. The grocery store called and said I either had to return to work or resign. This was a corporate wide policy. I resigned. The COBRA premiums were $790 per month. While I still had some savings, this was really beyond my budget. In September I got a job with a very small company. I work as an electromechanical tech fixing receipt printers. I have never removed my mask while in the building. Lunch? In my car. Sip of tea? Step outside. Snack or fruit? Step outside. On the 7th of this month one of my colleagues was in the same room as I and started to have a coughing fit. He ripped his mask OFF and coughed for 10 or 15 seconds. It must have been in that brief moment that he infected me. When I showed to work the next he was not in. I scheduled a PCR test and thankfully was able to schedule one for that Friday. When I woke that morning I had some unexplainable aches and pains. I was at work, but following my test appointment I went home. That night I had coughing, sore throat, runny nose, and a slight fever. It was either Thursday or Friday that I infected my wife.

We had been doing great before Omicron (keeping infection rate at 2% I believe... it is now at 30+%). [[url] There is so much information going on that I am having trouble making sense of it. Essentially people are worried that vaccines are causing issues or not working or something else is going on because these posts show more vaccinated people dying than unvaccinated. I would like to figure out how that translates with the high vaccinated population we have.

She does not get help for these issues and makes no effort to work through her behaviors, blaming shitty insurance coverage.

She also will not get vaccinated. She wants everyone in the house to be vaccinated (which, we are) but says that her anxiety makes her exempt from it. I at first tried being empathetic, had some talks with her about it, and hoped she'd come to a point where she fears COVID more than the vaccine. However, the opposite is true. She scares herself incessantly with medical articles about side effects from the vaccine and worries she'll die if she gets it. She ended up getting COVID after my dad and I got it. The entire time, I was worried she was going to die or be hospitalized due to the state of her health. Thankfully, she's ok, but her anxiety has now consumed her-- it's been weeks since and she will barely leave her room, disinfects everything, etc. She keeps me back from things in life because she wants me to protect her since she's unvaccinated. She won't allow me to see friends or get a new job. I don't see family or anything of the sort either. I'm very miserable and depressed, I love her but the untreated anxiety feels like a burden.

I keep reading headlines about how the booster is ineffective against omicron and this makes me think that getting a booster is sort of a pointless risk- why risk the side-effects of the booster when it won't even help me?

1198,s6nr73,1/18/2022 3:46,"Anybody want to read about something happy about poop? Epidemiologists have oddly learned that testing viral loads of municipal sewage is a remarkably accurate predictor of what will happen with cases, about a week in advance. This is proposed to be because this provides a comprehensive sample that includes asymptomatic cases, those that avoid healthcare or rely on non reported home tests, and may reflect viral loads. This correlation has proven accurate in many many municipalities across the last two years and therefore is increasingly more trusted. Again, a week ahead of cases and about two weeks ahead of hospitalizations, the sewage curves predict what will happen. In the US they seem to have peaked and are falling. In this one article the slope seems to be falling really fast.
