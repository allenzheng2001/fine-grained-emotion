FWIW, I also live thousands of miles from all of my family. My anxiety got pretty bad several months ago during the holidays when Covid was at its peak and was impossible to see people. I was also still furloughed from work and had a lot of time to think (and overthink). Ive dealt with mild anxiety in the past but nothing like this. During that time it got so bad that I drove thousands of miles to be with relatives. I was able to spend time with them in the evenings which was really helpful and eventually I felt back to normal for the most part. Since then Ive also gotten my job back. However, during the last month Ive gone through a breakup of sorts and that has brought my anxiety back. I lived alone for several years before this and it used to be awesome for me but now it just feels painful. Im almost afraid of being alone. My anxiety is always bad in the mornings; I dont get a lot of sleep because of it which makes it difficult to focus at work. Also, my anxiety gives me get bad stomach aches and I lose my appetite so it makes it really hard to eat. I usually have to force myself to eat every day which just isnt fun. My work is partially opened up and Ive been trying to go in at least a few hours a day just to be around other humans. That helps for sure. Ive been trying to take early morning bike rides as soon as I get up and that typically helps but in the few hours before work starts, Im still rather anxious. Ive tried meditating (which kinda makes things worse), journaling, watching mindless TV, reaching out to friends, etc. I talk to a therapist on a weekly basis which has been helpful. I tried antidepressants (SSRIs) for about 6 months or so and they made my anxiety worse at first and I didnt feel like they were super helpful after that.

I'm struggling so much at the moment with having any sort of hope for the future. It just feels like we will never get normality back. COVID has completely ruined me. I went from being a (mostly) happy and functional human to depressed and suicidal since 2020. I take anti depressants now and I started therapy but even on my good days, I still feel like there's this dark cloud over my head and I'm waiting for the next shitstorm. I live in the UK and we've had three long lockdowns. Everything was looking pretty hopeful a few months ago, but since the last lockdown rules started easing, cases and hospitalisations have started rising again, even though we're doing pretty well with vaccinations. Our Government have handled the pandemic pretty poorly throughout and managed to let the Delta variant in with their loose border control measures. It just feels like this never ending cycle of rising cases, lockdown, falling cases, lift lockdown, rising cases again, etc etc and I'm terrified of going into another lockdown in the Autumn. I can't do it again. We keep saying the lockdowns are to protect our (underfunded) NHS from being overwhelmed but if hospitalisations are already getting too high now in the SUMMER, how the hell will they cope with a Winter wave with not only COVID cases but also a new wave of Flu cases which have been low the last year because of the lockdowns??? I feel guilty for complaining as I know other people have it much worse, and having already had the virus, it's not affected me all that badly. But the restrictions have meant I can no longer do my job (musician), I can't meet a partner, I've lost all hope for the future and I just feel like I'm waiting for the next bit of bad news. If the vaccines aren't enough for getting us out of this shit, what will be???? I just don't feel like life is worth living anymore under these restrictions.

Evertime I'm happy or having fun or trying to make plans for the future I have a little voice in my head saying 'you can't relax because things are never gonna get better and nothing will work out'. I haven't felt true, unconditional joy since maybe August last year. This past year of isolation broke me completely and I feel like I will never be happy again. I hadn't been on antidepressants since 2019 and now I lost all my progress. I feel so guilty because my family and friends are all so excited and proud of me but I feel empty, scared and sad all the time. I just wish this never happened.","{'Annotation 0 | Assignment ID = 3M1CVSFP6AG22PLOV3NKIWLLBKWQAM | Worker ID = AM6H40LNWSFYA': [{'Emotion': 'fear', 'Abstractive': ""The lockdowns and the self-isolation have made me afraid to have fun because I'm so worried that lockdown is going to return and take away everything I love.

While the last year and a half have been trying emotionally and professionally for all of us, things are looking up with the vaccine. However, my wife's parents refuse to get vaccinated. They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws. This is becoming a big problem because I am building a startup and my cofounder is someone I met during the pandemic. He and I need to start building a more regular working cadence and relationship, but this is really difficult since my wife and SIL are not comfortable with me working in person with him, even though he is vaccinated (though he is much less careful than us).

At present, its actually against our guidelines to have so many people inside from different households, but this is meant to change at the end of July - unless cases continue to rise which they are. 2. Because of guilt if I decline and dont go, I dont want to let my friend down, I think she would probably stop inviting me places/to her wedding. And no one else in the group seems anxious over Covid, theyre all excited about going. I feel like if I say I cant go because of Covid, the group will all try and convince me it will be safe to go.

Ive been invited to a friends surprise hen-do in 1 month. Their maid of honour has rented a whole house for 3 days in a place 4 hours away. This would mean staying with approximately 12 other people, most who I dont know, not to mention sharing a bed and room etc. They have also planned lots of activities like paintball, laser tag, cocktail classes and dinners. Im feeling super anxious about the whole thing: 1. Because of Covid. I currently work in ICU, I caught Covid last year and had a real rough time recovering, and Ive barely gone out much except with close family. I am double vaccinated so that at least helps. At present, its actually against our guidelines to have so many people inside from different households, but this is meant to change at the end of July - unless cases continue to rise which they are. 2. Because of guilt if I decline and dont go, I dont want to let my friend down, I think she would probably stop inviting me places/to her wedding. And no one else in the group seems anxious over Covid, theyre all excited about going. I feel like if I say I cant go because of Covid, the group will all try and convince me it will be safe to go. I honestly dont know what to do, I know if I say I will go Im going to have so much anxiety all month leading up to it. I have to reply to the invite in the next few days.

When the pandemic hit, I was a junior so the rest of my high school experience was in the pandemic. I, recently, graduated back in June (in person luckily). For a graduation present, my parents got tickets for Disneyland for my 3 friends (all fully vaccinated). My family and I have been very proactive when it comes to Covid related things. The reason for this is for my brother who has Down Syndrome. Sadly, he is still to young enough to get vaccinated but will be before the end of the year (thank god). Before being vaccinated, I was only able to see my friends in person only a handful of times since the start of the pandemic. Now things are (hopefully) going in a better direction in America and I am struggling to decide if I should wear a mask at Disneyland. It is surreal to even consider not wearing masks in general. I feel confused about information because the CDC says it is safe to do so but the WHO recommends masks for everyone regardless of vaccination status. I am so conflicted on what to do because, in a selfish way, I dont want to wear a mask because I just want to go back to normal. On the other hand, I would feel guilty if I got Covid and gave it to my unvaccinated brother. I am still weighing the pros and cons because I am healthy teenager but I know the Delta Variant is the most dangerous strains yet.

Before I get into everything, I want to thank you for taking the time for reading this. When the pandemic hit, I was a junior so the rest of my high school experience was in the pandemic. I, recently, graduated back in June (in person luckily). For a graduation present, my parents got tickets for Disneyland for my 3 friends (all fully vaccinated). My family and I have been very proactive when it comes to Covid related things. The reason for this is for my brother who has Down Syndrome. Sadly, he is still to young enough to get vaccinated but will be before the end of the year (thank god). Before being vaccinated, I was only able to see my friends in person only a handful of times since the start of the pandemic. Now things are (hopefully) going in a better direction in America and I am struggling to decide if I should wear a mask at Disneyland. It is surreal to even consider not wearing masks in general. I feel confused about information because the CDC says it is safe to do so but the WHO recommends masks for everyone regardless of vaccination status. I am so conflicted on what to do because, in a selfish way, I dont want to wear a mask because I just want to go back to normal.

For reference, I was a 2020 high school grad so I was one of the thousands who was robbed of an actual graduation, prom, senior activities, etc. Then my first year of college was also kinda sucky. First semester of my freshman year, I stayed home and did courses online because I was nervous about the virus and getting infected. Also wanted to protect people and being younger, I had a fear of spreading it to older people. Second semester of college, I actually moved on campus where I met a lot of friends and had fun. But I always wore my mask, hung out with a few friends who also always protected themselves, and never went to parties despite most of the student body going to these parties every week.
