10,ovx9wx,8/1/2021 18:17,"Hi - I have a question about vaccines. Before I dive into my question, I ask that I am treated with respect. For context, I am in my early 20s, have no underlying conditions, and have natural immunity against COVID. I was living in an epicenter when covid hit and my entire family got sick. That being said, we all had mild symptoms and none of us were hospitalized. None of us have underlying conditions and we all live very healthy lifestyles. Because I've had covid already and I'm incredibly low risk for ever being hospitalized (I literally have antibodies and have had the disease already, which thankfully did not land me or my loved ones in the hospital), I really do not understand why I need to get the vaccine. I understand that I can have renewed, stronger protection as I had it a while ago and the antibodies induced by vaccines can generate a stronger immune response than natural antibodies, but I am just not really afraid of getting covid. If it were a matter of lowering transmission, that's a moot point because it has been shown that people with breakthrough infections have viral loads similar to those who are unvaccinated. As such, the only reason to get the vaccine is to protect yourself from hospitalization and/or death. I am not anti-vaxx and I think high risk individuals definitely should get the vaccine. However, I don't understand why I should risk potential side effects (even if they're rare) at this time. I do think we should do more to get high risk individuals in other countries vaccinated as well - I should not be a priority at all.

Saw that Delta Plus was trending and saw an article (which I couldnt read because it was behind a damn paywall) mentioning how South Korea (if memory serves me right?) found two cases of a so called Delta Plus variant even MORE transmissible than the regular Delta one. Needless to say Im spiralling. I was already having a very rough week in regards to the regular old Delta variant and was doing ok in terms of trying to avoid news and then this happens.

I say all of this to say Im lost, and I feel hopeless. We are both vaccinated, and have had our scares. She got vaccinated early on in December for obvious reasons. I was lucky in the fact I worked under the department of health umbrella for the state, and got my last Moderna shot in Feb 2021. She recently got Covid like a month ago, mild symptoms, we assume Delta. Lucky when I was tested, I surprisingly came back negative. So we are back to the norm if you will. However that lingering feeling of doom hangs over me. Im 30 years old, 60, and close to 300lbs. I know thats a risk factor, but my ice points out I have no other issues. I gained a lot of this weight in the last four years. I used to actually run half marathons and be fit. Im just still scared of getting Covid, and dying or getting long term side effects.. I do look for support from my wife, but I know she can only take so much, given her work place. I guess Im just looking for a steady view and direction, of how I should view my situation.

132,pnesgf,9/13/2021 12:52,"So in recent days, theres been a bunch of posts from my universitys subreddit calling for mandatory testing regardless of vaccination status. For context, my university has a vaccine mandate where ~99% are vaccinated, and a mask requirement. Now some students are calling for mandatory testing as well. They want transparency regarding the covid situation at my school. However, a point Ive often heard is that the vaccine does not prevent infection. It does, however, work to keep you from getting sick, so cases may not be the best metric post-vaccination. Now this may be different for places with low vaccine uptake, but my state has one of the highest vaccination rates in the country. Yet, these students defend their arguments by saying they dont want to spread it to their family, and even with a vaccine, if you could avoid the virus by staying home, then why not stay home. With all this in mind, Im afraid that if we get mandatory testing, people will freak out by seeing a high raw case number (and forget that the point of the vaccine is not to prevent infection), and go remote. I guess they do have a point to some extent. Given the situation of covid rn with the Delta variant, and hospitals in some states overwhelmed, theres still a need for vigilance. But I just feel like theyre completely overlooking the point of the vaccine here, and acting like its March 2020 again. I know that youre largely safe post-vaccination, and you always have to accept a certain level of risk in your life, and even with Delta, the vaccinated are still largely protected. Maybe theyre just a vocal minority, but Im afraid the administration takes their word and puts all of us back online. I just want to add - I know this post could make me come off as anti-restrictions at first, but Ive been following the restrictions since the virus hit and got the vaccine at the earliest opportunity, and Im 100% supportive of vaccine mandates to get us back to normal.

He literally does not go anywhere, he has no social life, so he was pretty much home 24/7 and I we would start butting heads more. He kept assuring me he'd go back eventually though.

On Tuesday I went to work on my scheduled in-person day. On Wednesday my aunt tested positive for COVID and I was informed that afternoon.

168,rinbot,12/17/2021 18:12,My mental health has been awful since March of 2020. I was in isolation for a year and a half before going to college fall 2021. This past fall my mental health has gotten a little better but now that I just got back from college this morning I already hate being back home. My dad keeps talking about how things will only get worse. Omicron is way more deadly and contagious than Delta and how if we dont isolate ourselves were gonna die. My family is fully vaccinated and my parents have also gotten a booster and I had Covid a month ago. I cant keep living like this. Ive been in isolation since I was 19. Im now 21 and Im so lonely and miserable and I have nothing to look forward to. I keep myself busy with art and I collect and read comic books but I still feel so empty and trapped. I sometimes wish Covid was deadlier so we can all die now and get it over with. I think being in isolation has given me CPTSD and I have very bad mood swings. I also have panic attacks every time my dad talks about how things will only get worse or that I have to learn to live like this.

178,rjxhqx,12/19/2021 14:10,"Hey everyone. So way back in August I got my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine at a CVS. I didn't carry my vaccine card at the time and let the pharmacist know as much. She told me that I could bring it in another day and get it filled out because my dose information would be in their system. Perfect, so I get the shot and go home. Three days later I come back to a CVS, and I'm asking a (different) pharmacist to fill out my card with the information in the system. He tells me there is no documentation of my second dose at all. He tells me to check with the state department and I do: they tell me the same thing. So apparently there is no information about my second vaccine dose, which has been pretty troubling considering you need the vaccine card to get into a lot of places now. In fact, this caused an extended crisis with my university where I was nearly removed from courses until I explained my situation to quite a few different people in higher positions. Obviously I'm tired of this whole thing. I was wondering if it would be a bad idea for me to just go on ahead and get two full rounds of the Moderna vaccine (in other words, just restart my vaccination process altogether).

I mean, remember we thought that this year in 2021, we thought it'll finally be the end of the pandemic since we've got the vaccines. Sadly, the pandemic didn't end this year and I was very disappointed about that. Sure, it's better than last year, but not the greatest recovery we ever had. Of course, we almost end the pandemic last summer until the Delta and Omicron came to stop it. I was hoping that 2022 may be the end of the pandemic and returning to normal, but with the Omicron (even though it's mild) going on, I'm not sure it'll end that quickly. As for the vaccines, I've just found out that our vaccination rate in the U.S. is 61% for fully vaccinated. Which is not bad, but it would've been higher. I've heard that we won't be back to normal until we reach either 80% or 90% vaccination rate, which I'm afraid it's going to be a long time, So I'm not sure it'll end next year.

We did not have any contact with my brother or SIL during these two weeks. Friday (New Year's Eve): My brother and his wife went out for New Year's Eve, and this is likely where they got covid (although they are not careful at all so it could have been before or after this, who knows) Sunday: My parents briefly met up with my brother in a parking lot to give him his kids back. My mom was masked and seated inside the car while my brother (NOT masked) had his head inside while he got the kids' car seats out. But she says there were 2-3 car doors open while this happened (i.e ventilation). My dad was masked and standing outside the whole time. The whole exchange was about 5-10 minutes and it was a windy day. Then my parents drove 3 hours back home, unmasked in the car. Monday: My brother's wife developed symptoms, she later tested positive Thursday: My brother developed symptoms (unsure if he had them earlier or if this was the first day) So my parents are isolating in their room just in case they have it and will get tested tomorrow on day 5.

274,s9ukqs,1/22/2022 4:58,"If there's one thing that's keeping me from going back to normal in my life, it's my fear of Long COVID. More specifically, the neurological symptoms of Long COVID. If the potential long term effects of COVID were things like joint pains, lung damage, and altered taste, and nothing else, I might be able to live with that. But the idea of me one day never being able to focus or remember things properly to the point where I'll never be able to find work or even do simple things like driving (which I love to do by the way) or even take a shower without feeling like I'll pass out for three days afterwards, is absolutely ***terrifying.*** But the worst part? The initial onset of symptoms doesn't seem to matter for your chances of getting neurological Long COVID. There have been reports of people with asymptomatic cases developing the condition. Scientists can't even seem to come to an agreement on how common Long COVID is, even though they've been monitoring this disease for two god damn years. I've seen reports of it ranging from 10% to 30% of all cases, and almost none of them give out data of how common it is for vaccinated patients. Even Chise, someone on Twitter that I've always looked to for reassurance, didn't do much when she posted data of how common Long COVID is for vaccinated patients, simply because it contradicts everything else that I had seen to this point, and my brain just doesn't know what to trust more. From what I've read, I'm at risk for neurological Long COVID. I may not have anything serious like Schizophrenia or Bi-Polar Personality Disorder, but my brain is still a hot mess of Pure-O, Anxiety, and possibly Autism and ADHD, almost all of which puts me at a higher risk. So...hooray me. The media seems to be putting more focus on Long COVID since Omicron's fatality rate seems to have gone down the toilet, which is only exacerbating my anxieties about it more.

We are all generally pretty good about taking Covid seriously, which includes wearing masks and getting the vaccine. Back in April, we attended the funeral of my mother-in-laws sister, which took place in a small rural town a few hours away where Covid is not taken seriously at all. When the funeral took place, my in-laws were fully vaccinated but I was only partially vaccinated. We get to the funeral, which was held indoors with probably 75-100 people present, and not a soul in there was wearing a mask, except me. For whatever reason, my family members decided to drop their precautions and go along with the majority consensus of the group and forget about Covid. I was very troubled by this, so the next morning I texted some of them and asked why they did not wear masks. I made a point to not bother texting my mother-in-law, though, because she had just buried her sister, after all. So I texted my father-in-law, and he did not take too kindly to the question. He said he felt it wasnt appropriate or necessary to wear a mask under the circumstances and that each person had to make their own decision. This was quite baffling to me because all of a sudden my father-in-law was starting to sound like the type of person you hear about who downplays Covid, even though hes happy to criticize people in other contexts when they disregard Covid safety protocols. I pointed out to him that CDC guidelines, at the time, stated that you should still wear masks, even when fully vaccinated. Anyway, he clearly told my mother-in-law that I posed this question, because I just found out that she is still upset, 4 months later, that I would even ask in the aftermath of her sisters funeral.
