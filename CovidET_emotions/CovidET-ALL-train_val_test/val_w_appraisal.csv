Not sure how common this is, though, and I've heard that natural immunity can still protect against Delta, so I'm taking this with a grain of salt.

While in France, some months ago I got vaccinated with Moderna, yet they only allowed me to get 1 dose since I had covid in December and officially that's how it works there since they count the antibodies produced by the infection as equivalent to having been vaccinated. Though honestly this left me a bit concerned since not all countries have this policy, as far as I know... I'm back in Mexico for the summer and vaccinations for the youth will begin next week in my city, offering Pfizer, Astrazeneca, Sputnik V and Sinovac. I'm considering on registering and taking my ""second dose"" here. Specially if it were Pfizer since I've read that mixing two mRNA vaccines might be the best bet according to some studies. My parents say I shouldn't ""risk it"" since according to France I'm fully vaccinated already. But my girlfriend is immunosupressed and it's always a little scary being close to her since because of my work I am out on the street often and she needs special care protocols to avoid getting infected. Can anyone help assessing me on making this choice? Thanks beforehand.","{'Annotation 0 | Assignment ID = 30MVJZJNHWO7BJ7687PBP0YFR68J9T | Worker ID = AM6H40LNWSFYA': [{'Emotion': 'fear', 'Abstractive': ""I'm concerned about getting my girlfriend sick especially because I'm not sure that my (one dose) <ORG> vaccination is good enough.
