# fine-grained-emotion
fine-grained emotion detection using cognitive appraisal theory

# BART/BERT:

predict multiclass based off text

# LR:
next step: read in appraisal vectors
- fillna(0)?

baseline for just appraisal vectors?

# BART/BERT revisited:

embed the appraisals into the text somehow
maybe there can be a hybrid with LR?

# LLM w/o appraisals

# LLM w/ appraisals, CoT, self-refinement
