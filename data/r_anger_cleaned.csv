0,Anger_1,Dry-Face-9099,Anger,Cat I hate Long story short I walk in the kitchen and see this cat I strongly dislike eating some of my food it had pulled off the stove. I grab the cat and start choking it. I got damn close to killing it before I stopped. That was the first time I had hurt a living thing. I've got the table in anger and thrown things before but never harmed anyone or anything. I'm kinda scared I could hurt somebody. Any thoughts?,92
1,Anger_2,TheNext22,Anger,"How do I influence? Am I part of the problem? My SO cannot have discussions or be criticized or take direction from me at all. He is volatile. The response is always escalation beyond anything called for. He starts talking in a loud snide voice, cursing and telling me all the ways I am a horrible person. I have told him that we cannot live like this. I'm getting older and my stress response worries me. I'm actually scared I am going to have a heart attack or stroke out someday because of his tirades. In most ways he is a good person. He is more than a bit lazy at home. 

In the past, I have capitulated to his rants. It always seemed like the easiest way to stop, but he has also ‚Äòblackmailed' me by asking where I'm going to go or telling me everything is his. After the anger calms, he always says he didn't mean it. 

This blowing up isn't good for anyone. I am so tired of stress response or just doing everything myself so I don't have to ask for help. 

My recent financial situation has changed. I could leave without taking anything from our marriage and it wouldn't leave me broke. But I do love him. I value our marriage, but I don't know how much of my stress hormones flying off the charts I can take. 

He reminds me of a two or three year old. How do I stop this insanity?",288

3,Anger_4,NeighborhoodBasic647,Anger,"His eyes turned black and he growled like an animal. Hey everyone, I'm not really sure where to post this, but I'm hoping you could give me some insight here. 

Growing up my father had intense anger issues, the sound of laughter too loud would set him off, but one really strange thing was that when he was angry his iris would turn completely black.

I also had an incident where I woke up one night with feeling the floor moving (We had a house with those old wooden floors), his girlfriend running into my room screaming ""your dad, your dad"", I got up and went to his room, it was destroyed, the cupboards had been ripped off, the bed was turned over and broken, as I was about to enter the room, I saw my father on his haunches in the corner, growling like an animal (if I didn't see him, I would have thought there was an actual animal in there), needless to say I turned around and walked out and the next day everything was back to normal.

I don't know if this ties in somehow, but when I was little I had extreme night terrors, that carried on for 5 years, I only slept through the night for the first time when I was 6. For 4 years I was terrified of eyes, my mom would have to come into the room with her head down and put my head over her shoulder, otherwise I would scream ""Your eyes, your eyes"". Maybe this ties into how my fathers eyes changed?

Now that I am an adult I'm trying to make my peace with these past events, but I am struggling to find an answer to these bizarre things. Has anyone ever been so angry that this has happened to you? or have you seen anyone that this has happened to?

Thank you in advance",363
4,Anger_5,coolkidthrowaway69,Anger,"Anger from childhood abuse advice? Hey guys, 

This is my first time posting here so please let me know if I have broken any guidelines and I will fix them.

Context (I hope this is more of a description than a rant): I am a highschooler if that matters, and I've only recently this year forced myself to remember memories of emotional/sexual abuse from my parents and it's really caused a lot of new anger.

I've been going through cycles of anger then guilt. And I'm not sure exactly what's happening, but I feel like I'm scared that I'm becoming my parents who abused me, because I've had so many instances where I could completely understand their exact logic in everything they've done to me, like when I almost raise my hand to hit someone I love or I feel an extreme urge to break something or punch a wall like they usually do. I feel like I'm almost walking in their footsteps and reliving THEM, and it makes me feel like an absolute monster.

How do I deal with this anger and fear? To me, it feels like it boils up until I can't control it and I have to hit something or cause some damage.",236
5,Anger_6,Different_Doubt42,Anger,"Angry without obvious reason in a course? Hey there! I'm usually a very chill person that gets loud every couple of years or so but not this time.

I have to take a course and while it isn't hard, it's rather boring, I just got so angry I actually tossed my book into the bin and left the room without saying anything. Nothing special happened, nobody said a thing to or about me.

I'm honestly shocked. I usually would never dare to to this, out of respect for the lecturer and for the book, but this time it was like blind rage flooded me and only when I was already walking for a couple of minutes I came back to senses.

What happened? How can I make sure that it won't happen again? I'm going to meditate an extra round but really..? What have I done?",169

I have thrown things in the past when angry, including glass cups and my phone. I have also hit my laptop when the wifi doesn't work or is slow. This occurs maybe 2-3 times a year. I do snap at family and curse, so I have considered pursuing therapy for a while. Do you think this would be a good idea?

 today i had very severe need for anger, i needed to punch some1 rlly bad. with pe i had to do a lay out the next exercise, i declined with respect, but he said i must do it. i humbly declined again, but he wouldnt take it. so i did the lay out, i was mad. i finished the lay out while being constantly corrected.

10,Anger_11,Internal-Inflation33,Anger,"Anyone else have an issue with becoming un-angry? Sounds weird, I know. When I am triggered and become EXTREMELY angry, it takes me multiple days to get rid of the residual anger. Even after the event has happened, and been wrapped up, I still can't shake the anger caused by the situation for a few days. 

I am wondering if there are people who have similar issues, and what ways you have found to let go of the residual anger/cope? 

It seems so absurd intellectually to still hold onto things, but I still can't shake it. 

For context, my biggest trigger in the world is Dog urine or feces in my house. My boyfriend absolutely loves dogs and got a Beagle about 6 mos. ago. I on the other hand could do without ever seeing a dog again, but I put up with them. My one condition was that she be potty trained. She is potty trained, however, she is scared of literally EVERYTHING and also doesn't like me, so when he is gone she gets anxious and any loud noise or sudden movement has her peeing, trembling, whining, teeth chattering, the whole nine yards. She has even peed on my pillow in my bed before. It sends me through the roof, so much so that I need to leave so that I do not become violent. The thing that sucks is that other than her noise phobia, peeing, and separation anxiety from my bf, she is a very sweet and well trained dog. Her and I just do not get along, especially when she pees out of fear. 
BUT I hold onto the anger of wanting to just beat the hell out of her for days. So much so that I can't focus on anything and I can't stand to be around her.",347

20,Anger_21,Responsible-Cod8028,Anger,"Uncontrollable anger attacks For seemingly ridiculous reasons I get bursts of uncontrollable anger. Sometimes for no reason, I just burst into rage and attack everything around me. Slamming walls, attacking my pillow, screaming, uncontrollable embarrassing laughter or crying.

I talked to him recently about it and he says that he gets super nervous and looses all rational thoughts, overthinks things, and has a one track mind. I understand him now, but it still upsets me when he starts yelling and won't listen to anything I say, only insisting on his point of view. 

Example: When I tried speaking about him to go away for college, he kept talking loud/screaming that I was dumb and didn't know anything. Later on, when I told him my decision he was upset that I didn't talk it over with him.

I like to think Ive improved how I approach my anger in my relationships (Ive learned to keep things to myself by being more quiet and not engaging in gatherings / discussions as much). The issue is that this has caused me to become more distant and I keep to myself a lot more. I don't spend time with my family out of fear that they'll make me angry and Ill develop a deeper hatred for them which I don't want.

It feels like theres no winning because if I was as social and spent more time with them, it creates more opportunity for arguments and my anger to come out. My only approach has been to distance myself and develop a more surface-level small-talk type relationship. Ive been in a better place emotionally with this approach but I hate the fact that I may become too distant.

The main cause of the arguments and fights is that my family often tries to control my every-decision and criticize my choices that affect them in no way at all.",235

I said i noticed that when he was talking too quickly, in a frantic tone or dramatic tone for too long (past 10mins) that my adrenaline would kick in and my heart would start thumping like I was in fight mode. 

I have issues with my childhood where I was verbally abused and made to endure it for hours. Now my choices to manage my anxiety and adrenaline are usually to slow down my speech and hope they would chill out too.. drop sarcasm.. or start criticising.. or walk away from unpleasant encounters. That is, if was at a manageable level. I have told him he can distract me with a change of topic or music..

I haven't found a way to manage the anger I feel especially when being lied to by stupid little things frequently by family. I almost always go nuclear on the person and point out their awfulness and personality deficits.

So while talking to him, he said something that made me curious. I found it interesting my anger dropped to a mid background level when I was curious. I am not sure which part of the brain is activated when curious- but it does seem I chanced upon a way to rewire my brain from the anger switch..

24M and I recently discovered that I have some anger issues. 

It usually happens in two cases: 

1) either when someone belittles me, like for example when they say stuff like ""ah he doesn't know shit"" or ""your opinion aint worth shit"".  However, I don't get triggered when I am called words at all. 

2) or whenever someone starts mocking me. For example, whenever I hear ""yeah whatever"", ""blablabla"", ""yea sure just stfu"" while I am trying to explain my point of view.

Throughout my life I had those minor outbursts of violence, where i bit people, kicked them etc. then in effort of stopping it, i turned to myself and whenever anger got too overwhelming i would hit myself on the head but that just made me look like i'm unhinged and crazy, so not ideal either. I stopped both of those behaviours 2-3 years ago and I just pinpointed it to teenage hormones/rebellion. i was so sure i got a hold of my violent outbursts, put them past me. i was doing so well, those outbursts were no longer a thing, whenever i was about to throw a rage fit i managed to cool down. but today it came back all over again.
now i am seriously afraid I might hurt someone in the future out of anger. or even k*ll them. i'm legit afraid of myself. cause in the moment when i am angry, sometimes i experience such blinding rage that i seemingly can't stop myself.  i am so afraid that in the future i will hurt my potential boyfriend, friends, family. if this never stops, maybe someday i'll go to jail for abuse. i don't want that. i don't wanna be a bad person. i want to get better.

Whenever I'm upset with someone, I'll open a Google Doc, write in detail how I'd hurt them until I feel no longer anger, then I'll delete the doc, and move on. Is that not a healthy response to those situations? It's not like a literally hurt anyone so I can't see how it would be bad.

I have tried a lot of times - and with a lot of money - to manage my anger issues, but to be honest the feedback I've got from a few different counsellors and psychotherapists has been along the lines of ""well - everybody gets really angry sometimes"", ""you have Aspergers so it's quite normal"", ""you find yourself in a lot of situations at work and in your personal life that anybody would find stressful"".

I had to go to the post office to pick it up. When I get there I tell the lady and ask why I'm here essentially why can't they just deliver to my fucking door. She says that it'd take the workers too long to do that because our complex gets so many packages. I'm soo annoyed. I feel inconvenienced because of the drive there and how absolutely unnecessary this is. It's like the residents are being punished because we order packages. Ridiculous.

So I can't relate in the slightest when my sister goes into a flying rage because I didn't make extra food for her for breakfast or something, culminating in slamming doors and yelling and calling me an asshole or a jerk or annoying or a bitch.
I find this kind of ironic because all I was doing was sitting and eating breakfast and reading a book while she was the one being disrupting. Personally I would never even consider expecting someone else to cook my breakfast but I guess she was?

Usually what I do when something like this happens is leave the room and/or listen to white noise and continue what I was doing to try and drown out her yelling, which is one of the sounds that I'm sensitive to from being autistic. I'm usually just mildly confused and overwhelmed when she has outbursts.

I have been having anger issues for a long time now. I had anger issues in kindergarten and in elementary school and have been to a psychologist in second grade because my situation was that bad. Nowadays, the issues are much worse, I have lots of stress on me currently with online school and all kinds of things related to it, I am very tired because I am also not getting enough sleep.

Whenever I get angry, I usually just have to smash whatever it is in my hand (controller, pen, notebook etc) against the surface that is closest to me, let it be my desk or bed. This has not only caused me and my family hundreds of dollars of damages, but I also usually get hurt in the process. Sure, wounds can heal, but having them in the first place because of a mental breakdown because my pen has dried out is a pretty fucked up thing in my book. 

I tried putting said things down before starting to hit something, but I just have zero self control and can't consistently do so. I also tried calming myself down by just staying still and doing nothing, but that usually gets me even more angry and I cause more harm to myself. I tried hitting other things like my pillows, but that causes almost the same effect as staying still. And after I break something I get sober and realize what I just did and get a bad feeling of doom or whatever that is.

Is there any way I can at the very least minimize these breakouts? It's starting to get very expensive and I have a feeling if this worsens, many other things are on the way that could completely ruin me, as if I am not that bad already.",366

Anger is NOT your weakness, it is your secret source of power.

Unlike those who do not suffer from anger issues, we can effectively use it as motivation and as most of you know, you can do things when you are angry that you would never do when you are calm.

In my case, I was struggling with my college classes while suffering from depression which of course made me angry. It was so easy to blame the world or anything really when in reality, I was angry at myself for not doing better. That's when it hit me. I am pissed, so mad in fact that I used it as motivation to take back control of my life. I failed a test? Instead of letting go of that rage by breaking things, I focused it on what I have to do to be the best version of myself I can be. I couldn't wait to kick the crap out of that upcoming test or punching alcoholism in the face. I know it's metaphorical, but I hope you get the point. Channel your darkest emotions into something productive, like Jordan Peterson says ""Become a monster"". That overwhelming feeling you have is not something to be embarrassed about, it is a part of you and it will most likely be for the rest of your life. Use it

Take control of the steering wheel, next time something pisses you off, count to ten or one hundred, take your time and think about what you can do. Talking to yourself helps.

Yesterday I had an intense feeling of heat and irritation. I was shouting without realizing it, and it kept getting so much worse and worse the more I'm aware of it. 

I had a thought, what if it's just energy? Like an overcharge from food / sugar / caffeine? 

I'm lazy and I hate working out. But I needed to try because the anger was driving me crazy and I will end up taking it out on my loved ones ( by being an antsy cunt not abusing anyone verbally or physically ) or myself eventually.

I went to the gym, played some music and oh my god. I wanted to run forever, I worked out for 2 hours and constantly felt so much relief, I kept getting calmer and calmer and eventually felt like I took a giant shit after a week of constipation. It was amazing.

My anger comes from excess energy I believe. I have never deflated my anger faster and more effectively and never felt at ease from the heat like I did.

I don't even really know how to describe this relationship, it feels like a friend that I don't really like and doesn't really like me.

186,Anger_187,Different-Ad1976,Anger,"As a young person, just starting out, I don't know how to deal with my disappointment about things, which turns into anger. I haven't always been this angry. I'm only 25 years old, and I honestly have a very easy life when it comes to outside appearance. However, as someone who was diagnosed and struggles daily with Pure OCD, my mental state is normally one of internal hell. I wish I could be happy, and often I try to be, even if that makes me feel like a madman, faking my emotions. 

In terms of life itself, I just get super depressed thinking about it, because what's the point of me enjoying it or doing anything if I keep hearing these intrusive thoughts in my head, saying how worthless and evil I really am toward others (maybe not in my actions towards them, but my opinions of them.) What is especially hard about these mental battles, is how truly alone I am within them. I can't possible be able to explain them to every person I know. It's super hard, because if I turn to family, sharing how I feel, they will worry about me and little else will happen, because I'm not going back to therapy (ERP, CBT, etc), because it didn't work and only made me more angry and depressed. 

So therefore, I'm alone in this battle, having to manage it mentally throughout the day, while also trying to get my life together. I wish I was more happy-go-lucky as I was during teenage years, but instead, I react to so much with swearing, frustration and irritation, even if I don't want to.",328

My older brother is on the autism spectrum, and I can't control my rage around him. I'm living at home right now, so I'm near him 24/7. He's not a bad or mean person, but he can be extremely inconsiderate and say things that come off as entitled, judgey, or rude. For example today he accused me of being a racist because I said I don't like driving downtown (because the traffic is worse and people drive so frantically.) 

Most of the time it's fine, but sometimes he'll say something that irritates me, and it's like I black out and lose control of myself and just want to hurt him as much as I can. Today I told him I hate him, his personality is unlikable, he shouldn't talk to me, etc. Last week he commented on my portion size at dinner (he weighs about 100 lbs more than me btw) and I threw my food at him. I've literally never lashed out violently at anyone like that.

I don't have these problems with anyone else. After I rage at him I always feel guilty and am scared that one day I'll cause him to have a mental breakdown or commit suicide. I feel awful that I am putting strain on my family, and my parents are so much more patient and kind to my brother.

growing up, i was mocked and laughed at for expressing any emotion. this resulted in a lot of built up, unresolved anger that has plagued me since i was little. im sure this isnt a new story for any of you.

i usually tremble a shit ton, i cry, i scratch myself, i throw things, i break things, all without a second thought. 
ive delt with my anger in the form of physical harm. if i wanted to avoid hurting myself, id take a bunch of drugs to basically immobilize myself.

as of recently whenever my anger spikes i take a hit, which brings me back down. unfortunately, due to me also using thc for my chronic illness, ive had to take a break in order to avoid it becoming a habit. im aware using thc to deal with anger isnt the best way to go about it. unfortunately there arent many outlets for me, as (like i said) im chronically ill and have trouble even leaving my room. even then, my family is almost always the cause of these spikes. due to my ailments i havent been able to leave my situation.

i also have Dissociative Identity Disorder, which doesnt help because one of my alters literally feeds off of anger. its almost like someone encouraging me to drive myself over the edge. he enjoys the anger, he enjoys the mutilation.

For the last 1.6 years I've been actively working on boosting my mood and generally becoming a more likable person. I've started: going to the gym regularly, leathercraft, writing, taking walks into forests, working on risk adversity, learned how to ride a dirtbike and using it regularly. 

Each time I do something that I deem ""good"" or ""productive"" I feel like I'm adding a perfectly balanced card on a perfectly balanced house of cards but once some bad thing happens (like the car braking down, the heating system not working, etc...) that house of cards is blown away by a tornado of boiling anger and smoldering resentment that I spread around like a malignant cancer.

I've lately taken to simply going silent and avoid speaking altogether when these things happen but that only delays things. The feeling that I have to be on my toes because everyone is out to get me is omnipresent and the only moments in which I can still my thoughts is when I have to fully focus on something like in dirt bike riding or leather crafting.

This constant bitterness keeps piling and piling up giving fruit not only to suicidal thoughts but also to an extremely aggressive inner voice that lashes out internally with extremely hateful monologues towards myself and others. 

I am aware that I need professional help but I am also unsure what kind of help I should seek. Group therapy? Psychologist? Taking a break from my normal life and changing the scenery altogether? It's not very clear and I also feel kind of reluctant to share thoughts that I am ashamed of with a complete stranger.

These days I don't have explosive anger but death anxiety, my nights are usually filled with insomnia and panic attacks, not sure if anyone related to this but this is just something I wanted to share.How going through a caffeine withdrawal fixed my anger I've been very short tempered in most of my adult life, most of the time, overreacting to situations that would frustrate me, and making a scene or taking it on people who had nothing to do with what would annoy me.

Then after a while, I would start feeling guilty over this and apologize, and the cycle would repeat over and over, I suspect that most of you can relate to this feeling.

I started reading a lot of self-help books for my anger, it didn't get much better. I started blaming my anger on my caffeine consumption, so I quit coffee and all caffeine.

After going through a very painful withdrawal and being caffeine-free for nearly three months, I began to realize that caffeine was not what would make me overreact and have a low frustration tolerance.

So I began to drink coffee again after nearly three months of abstinence and this time I decided to take some responsibility for my actions, I started blaming less and being kinder, I noticed I am way patient and more mindful of myself and other people.

I don't know why that is, but perhaps not blaming coffee has something to do with this, my rationalization that something external was to blame and the responsibility shifting towards me I think could have helped, now I am drinking coffee freely without fearing having to go through another withdrawal because it's no longer the coffee, I fixed myself.",368

Usually he does get to the door first ‚Äì afaik he's had help to get to this better baseline and this flash rage used to be a bigger problem previously.


- Any sort of tips so this doesn't keep costing him loads of money? - Is there anything cheaper than hundreds and punchable/throwable that he could place on/by his desk that would provide a satisfying flash rage outlet?

I'm always wrong. She's always right

I have asked for a divorce and she believes we have a chance.

with her I have no focus on my life, no will or ambition.

I don't feel anything positive from her side.

The focus is always on her problems, I let her say what she wants, the way she wants and try to show her a different prospective.

Today, my mind is just mildly irritated at the thought of coming back to work but my bladder has gone crazy. My body becomes tense every time I either get irritated or worried.

You see others playing these types of games on stream and see the regular time to time anger... maybe some loud yelling, or name calling, and some emotion, sometimes. 

That's normal, and its also normal to have that be the outlier, when other factors in your life aren't in place and the game drives you over the edge for a little bit, and after a while you admit that was a bit of an overreaction. 

Well this overreacting is my normal. If I die once to someone online, Anger flows. Everything in the title, Multiplied by 100. I want to rip throats out, destroy stuff. I hate the other person and wish them the worst. The anger regularly and easily becomes physical. Damage to walls, the phone itself, recently an iPad I smashed, and one time to myself. My hands start spasming with the anger. I've completely destroyed iPhones, leaving them in mangled electrical heaps of aluminum. One time, the pure anger was so intense from an online death, I clawed my own face and left marks running down like a demon came at me in the night. That kid you see online smashing his keyboard or knocking over some bottles, and people laugh at him on YouTube for getting loud? 

Im on here because people see much less emotional reactions as non normal, and weird. I'm the extreme of the extreme I believe. 

Anger to the point where I am plain MURDEROUS. Damage to myself, and Wishing for damage to other people. 

All of this, of course, paired with screaming. Screams so loud and emotional that I'm almost embarrassed to know people regularly hear me.

In the past, I used to cope with anger by removing myself from the situation and then beating myself with a ruler or anything else I could find. In the past few years, however, my coping method has shifted to something completely different. Now I will spend hours imagining doing terrible things to the people that anger me. I will imagine things ranging from tying them up and chopping off fingers to stepping on their heads and pushing them into the mud until they drown. I get so much pleasure out of it, it is incredibly difficult to stop in the moment, and I am sure I would indulge in some of these fantasies if there were no consequences. Just to be clear, I am still in enough control to not actually hurt anyone, I simply cannot control my thoughts. Anyway, after an ""anger episode"" the original trigger will usually not disturb me nearly as much as it originally did, and I regret the things I imagined while being angry. I have a very vivid imagination, so I am almost able to see these actions in my mind in most cases, which I will often find disturbing after I am done being angry. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this, or should I just let it be since it has been an effective method of dealing with my anger?",288

I make myself terrified to have kids from how I've reacted in the past. It's been a few weeks since this has happened and it isn't often, but I need to reach out for help. 

We recently got a new puppy and every time I've seen him hump something, I go rage-blind. My partner says it's natural and normal and chuckles it off, but he doesn't see how I react when no one is there to make me reconsider myself. My puppy hasn't humped anything in front of me in weeks so I don't know if I 'beat it out of him' or it's just natural to not hump very often at 5 months. I don't know. 

Anyway. Last time he humped his toy I screamed, threw things, held him down, and seeing his dog penis outside it's sheath sent me so over that I started hitting his penis hoping to make his dog-boner go away. Once I realized what I was doing I stopped, left him alone for a long time, and we are fine now. I did not injure him, and he is not acting afraid of me. Since that incident I have stopped screaming at him altogether and while he's occasionally obstinate, he's a good boy and I don't think it damaged our relationship too much. 

I don't even want to admit this but part of me is afraid I haven't reacted that way again simply because the incident hasn't presented itself again.

Yes, I too have an anger problem. After going to anger management and confronting my anger directly through therapy, I have developed a way to handle things without ""blowing up""; but nevertheless I still privately get furious. All of the physiological symptoms are there, and I can feel myself gearing up to get physically aggressive or confrontational even prior to the disagreement getting to that point. It's like my body pre-empts my next stage of anger. 


Since taking anger management, I have been successful in keeping several issues in balance. For instance, I no longer get loud or animated, I don't initiate a physical altercation, I don't curse, or even get close to the person I am in a confrontation with. Now, I simply walk away. I say, ""Okay, that's fine. I disagree."" And I walk away or leave the situation if required. 

Walking away instead of exploding has cost me two close relationships; a college friend and a girlfriend. When I write this all out, it seems like I am doing the right thing for me and everyone else there. I feel like I am showing that I am taking concrete steps to address my anger. But what am I missing? I got very strong reactions from both of my ex-friends/gf (clearly); but it wasn't like I told them off. I just ended my participation in the argument.

Before, I would be more sad when I'm upset but now it's become more of a low boiling anger until something happens and I lose my shit (kind of like how my mom behaves). I yell at the littlest (albeit, recurring) things, and sometimes I shove him and sometimes I straight up slap him when he peeves me.

Consolidated version:
We have a 24 hour hormone cycle. 

In the morning we have higher testosterone, giving us more energy while also making us easily agitated. Short fuse to anger. 

Mid day we fall into a more balanced level; we still have energy but are not as quick tempered.

Evening time brings our lowest levels resulting in typically calmer, more passive mood. 

Obviously diet, age, genetics, and I'm sure many other things affect our individual cycles and levels. 



I am not saying we can blame our anger issues on this.  I've had my own issues my entire life and only started working on them 6 or so years ago. 

I am saying to understand at certain times we are more susceptible to anger, and other times more open to contemplation. 




P.s caffeine, alcohol, physical activities, and other substances/instances also affect testosterone use. I have not had alchohol for 4 months now and no caffeine for a month. I won't say I found snake oil, but I have personally found my days easier to manage/less intense.

When I get these anger attacks my strenght increases considerably, I train and lift weights but I'm not especially strong, just around average, but I become at least x2 stronger when I have rage attacks. I've bent stuff that I wouldn't bend in a million years in a normal state, I've thrown heavy stuff that I wouldn't be able to throw that far in a normal state. Once I was able to bend a small wrench, (If you've ever tried to bend a wrench you'll realize how hard it is) now I try to bend it while not having a rage attack and I can't bend it even a little bit...

I also have suicide thoughts and think about killing the other person I'm angry at. It lasts for like 20 minutes and then goes away. My therapist knows about this, but the process of rehabilitation is long and tedious.

I feel extremely miserable when this happens, because a part of my knows that if I severely hurt someone or kill them I'm gonna end up in jail, or killed by police (because I'd do anything to avoid getting caught).

Been on and off this subreddit on many accounts.

Always tried to speak from my own experiences, about venting, raging and yes, going to a therapist. 

It's been a while since I last went to see someone, they helped me a lot and I felt things were going fine.

However I just found out my sister is all bruised up cause a guy couldn't keep his hands to himself.

She's fine and staying with our sister, but a part of me wanted to go find him and go full apeshit on his ass untill there's nothing left.

I won't though, I refuse to.

So I did what my therapist taught me and found a controlled environment to vocalize my feelings let me rage. But it's a good time to go back and talk to a professional about it.

Sometimes I just want to be left alone but the reality is I can't always have alone time. 

But when my son pushes me to my limit I'm mad for what seems like an hour and I not only yell at him but my fianc√© as well. 

It's gotten to the point to where we have sex less often (which a lack of sex makes me crabby)

We have had several conversations about my anger and how I treat the people around me, but idk what gives? Why am I like this?

She says that I have anxiety but I don't think so. Sometimes I just get so mad that everything pisses me off and makes me angrier. 

Sometimes, I have no idea why I'm mad. I smoke a lot of weed which in itself is supposed to help calm me down (which it does) but sometimes it's not enough. 

I wish I could calm down with the snap of a finger but it's easier said than done.

I really want to be better at everyone whenever I feel like I'm in a competitive environment and to make things better iI make literally everything competitive. I can't take criticism and I'm just not a good person. I want to blame my ""childhood trauma"" but i don't even feel bad for myself because I'm extremely unsympathetic.

When I am feeling irritated or angry, she shuts down and ignores what I am feeling. She doesn't try to ask me what's wrong or try to help me work through these feelings. I have had anger issues for a while now, as I am a FTM transgender man on T for 3 years it seems as though my sadness festers into anger more often than not. We have both suffered because of this and I explained to her that it would help me a lot to discuss these feelings or for her to even show some compassion toward them but due to her trauma with anger issues that her stepdad exhibited, she shuts down when people are angry. She has a hard time feeling anger herself.

In fact, there are multiple people in this person's life that believe this. The thing is, I'm not sure if they even realize they have anger issues. They explode from seemingly small things and blow situations out of proportion. On occasion, they won't listen to reason and go on verbal outbursts (it's never physical thankfully.) From what I've witnessed, they seem to believe that things are never their own fault. 

I'm afraid to even bring this up to them as a serious topic because, well, I think they'll react with anger and disbelief. It can be exhausting spending time with someone like this and I can only imagine how much it effects their own life. But we're tired of trying not to step on any toes, and it's clearly negatively impacting themself.

Any advice on how we could possibly bring this up to them, or how to handle this kind of thing?",210

This entire year has been one anger-inducing thing after another. I've been stuck working part-time and struggling on a lower income because the pandemic has made it hard to find jobs, or the ones that have been available are so public-facing and dealing with people who are taking ZERO pandemic precautions that I can't justify taking them (My father, who I'm in contact with frequently, has COPD and heart problems, so any kind of exposure risk is just unacceptable). The Presidential race was just one long nightmare slog, seeing one probable sexual predator pitted against another. My city and state government (living in Oklahoma) have actively made the pandemic worse here with their utter ineptitude and ideological fuckery. But honestly, I've gotten used to that. I'm used to struggling financially. I'm used to incompetent government making things worse.  


But my grandfather is dead. Two of my best friends are badly sick with COVID. And everywhere I go, I see idiots just blithely walking around without masks, ignoring any attempts at mitigation, and it just feels like I'm watching murderers walk free. People like that killed my grandfather, are killing my friends. I'm just full of anger all the time and I don't know what to do with it.  


I've looked online for suggestions, and all I'm seeing is stuff I've employed in the past that's not working for this. I know exactly why I'm angry and who I'm angry at and it feels like there's nothing I can do. It feels like I'm just screaming into the void, trying to get someone to see sense, but nobody's listening.

My physical disability is called Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy which is a muscle-wasting condition. As result, I use an electric wheelchair. 

Recently, I've been really struggling with dealing with my frustration and anger, and have been lashing out at my younger brother (18) and my parents (both in their 50s). I want to stop lashing out at them since it doesn't make me feel better and my family doesn't deserve the way I'm treatment them. they support me a lot despite the way I'm acting. 

Some of the reasons for my frustration/anger:

* Ableism (discrimination against disabled people)
* Inaccessibility
* Bureaucracy and lots of paperwork  from various government departments 
* Lack of Social Relations: I haven't seen my friends in a while. Also if I don't initiate contact, they don't reach out.

Its clear to me that these games are designed to provoke that sort of fury, which is obviously manipulative and toxic. Most gamers wouldn't hang around a person who continually goads them into a towering rage, so why tolerate that from games? Oddest of all is that no one in the comments ever says 'games that make you feel like shit are shitty games, and not worth your time and energy.'

392,Anger_393,KaptainKopterr,Anger,New here - Yelling Issues Hi everyone! Looking to address my yelling and Anger. As a child my mom yelled pretty constantly. Said a lot of very horrible things to my father and it really has affected him. I am 30 years old and in a 6 year relationship that is on the rocks due to my yelling and anger. Seeing a therapist and taking Cymbalta for depression. My fianc√© though bless her heart grew up in basically the complete opposite environment with ZERO yelling. Don't want to end up like my parents but not sure how much hope there is for me and her anymore seeing as how opposite that is. I don't want to continue to yell and put her down anymore because I do love her. Is there any hope?! Thank you üôè,149

how do you control it? how do you channel it? where do you channel it? how do you let go? why does the world create so much for me to be angry at?

The past few months or so I've been looking to move to another state which I was originally going to do last summer but due to Covid it fucking derailed those plans. The last year and a half I have been working 2 jobs almost every single day saving up lots of money to move and still no place lined up to stay. I wanted to be moved out last month and have had horrible luck finding a place to rent and all the potential roommates have been hella flaky. I applied for a loan on a manufactured home and that got rejected yesterday. My family keeps telling me I'm selfish for wanting to move and that makes me more angry. I desperately want to move as soon as possible. Lately I've been getting angry outbursts where I have the urge to punch or kick something and feel like I'm going to snap any day now.,180

I've always had issues since I was little but my mum refuses to get me help as she thinks it's a waste of time. 

When I get really angry I shout, threaten people and have (in the past not recently) hurt someone physically. I feel like a different person when I get angry I get the urge to lash out and hurt them emotionally or physically in the moment I don't care. 
Over the past month I've had family issues and it's made me extremely annoyed and I can't stop being angry even over little things. Lately when I've been angry I'm starting to get physical again after years of not. I've started to threaten people more and I've shoved people or pushed them. It's been a while since I really hurt someone but I can feel myself getting to that point again.

I get most mad at myself. The smallest thing could happen like losing my pen or feeling
too hot and I'll start berating myself while shouting at people. I'll start shouting about how I'm a failure or I'm stupid and I feel like I'm manipulating people into feeling bad for me but I'm not. 

When I get the urge to hurt others I hit myself as I'm mostly always mad at myself. I'm not a danger to others around me as I know not to hit people but I still get the urge to. 

I don't know how to handle it and it's affecting the people around me. How do I make them realise I don't mean to do what I do or I don't mean what I say? Is there a way I can control myself?

Simply, this is my fight/flight response (the [last one I posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCN66zsAQce/) was the freeze/dissociation response.)  I used to turn that monster on myself, it kept me safe and out of trouble, but I had a lot of internalized hatred.

IFS therapy really opened me up to seeing why that protective part was so...evil? haha.  I've long since embraced it as a strong and powerful part of myself that I can use when needed to stand up for myself.  

The problem of course is that I don't just stand up for myself, I send out a fucking nuke.  I hate positivity culture that tells me this part is wrong, but I also hate hurting people I care about.

When he is mad and feels like he's not in control of his life, he likes throwing sorta-light things or knocking over stuff, especially if it creates a loud sound. Some examples are.. plastic bottles of soap, rolls of dog poo bags, plastic bottles of cleaning supplies.. I think he would be an avid bowler if it was safe enough to do so yet LOL Does anyone have any ideas? I was thinking heavy beanbags or empty water bottles with beads or something inside them, but I also worry about him throwing them at a wall too hard or something and making a hole. I'm sure that I'm not the first person to think of this - I remember there was a This American Life episode about kids processing grief and they had a kid-friendly rage room as part of their therapy center..

Recently has been a very difficult time for me, I am 19 and haven't faced many mental health problems but I am now at a point where i feel extremely overwhelmed.

I have developed an extreme fear of the idea of death, this is both the idea of the everlasting darkness and emptiness of death after you die alongside a fear that a family member of mine may die soon. I have lost sleep and appetite as my mind is only orientated around this idea of death. I try to distract myself but its near impossible that this thought doesnt come back soon. Epsically now with Covid being around, it appears every 24 hours you get the update of how real death is.

I feel like mostly any issue in life in fixable, i.e reparing a car, fixing a relationship, working towards stopping an addiciton. But any way i try to approach this idea of death, it isnt a fixable issue. Death is going to occur regardless and the idea of this is terrifying me.

Essentially, I am reaching out to see if anyone themselves has been through this and what has helped them. Frankly, I am desperate and need help with this issue. I've been in contact with a counselor but the weekly sessions have been meeting my needs and my fear isn't getting any better,

I kinda got rejected by a girl. It's more complicated then that, but that's the basic jist of what happened. The two of us were planning on meeting up this Saturday, but she's been acting kinda strangely and seems to want to change those plans. Seems like hanging out with me is a chore she has to get through rather then something she'd enjoy. 

Either way, all of this really frustrated me. It's not her fault though. She has every right to like someone else and be with them. I never really allowed myself to get to attached to her as a crush anyways. However, it still left me feeling angry. I've been struggling with my mental health over the last year and I feel a lot better now. I understand that my fear is a natural reaction and that from that fear came out anger, frustration and other bad thought. I've lost trust in her and feel like I don't wanna have anything to do with her anymore.

So what should I do? How do I redirect these negative feeling into something else. I understand that they are just psychological and biological reactions if my body to rejection, but that still doesn't stop them from hurting.",261

Well now she's back, going to the school I just graduated from (She deferred a year). I let her crash at my place for a week while she her new apartment was getting prepped. I even went to a open house for her before she got back because she wasn't in town yet and school was starting soon.

Well now she's been back for 2 months, and I gotta say I feel pretty betrayed. She never reaches out to me, I have to initiate everything. When we hang out, it's always a blast. But we rarely hang out. She knows how to say the right things, like wishing me a happy birthday and sending a nice message, but there's no actions behind it.

Now granted our school is very tough. I went through the same curriculum last year, and it was incredibly busy. But I still made time for friends. 

I've been so mad everyday because she's supposed to be a close friend, but it feels like she doesn't care about me anymore.

My anger is most likely a symptom of my long standing anxiety (been on sertraline and buspirone for about 15 years now) but it's never caused this much anger.

Quick rundown: my gf and I moved from one small town (pop. 400) to another (pop. 450) in January to relocate for my job. Everything was great until spring came and I started to notice the town is filled with the loudest people/music/cars/dogs I've ever seen outside of a big city. My gf definitely noticed it too, but it doesn't bother her as much as it does me. 

I've tried everything I can think of to drowned out the noise, or ignore it, or accept it, but it takes all of my energy to the point that it ruins our home life and I feel like shit for that. All I can think about is confronting these people in a not-so-nice way even though that would just make things worse. I feel like I'm turning into a crotchety insufferable old man at 32. It's not like I hate all loud noises either! I go to metal concerts, ride snowmobiles, etc. I just have a consideration for a peaceful neighborhood where others don't seem to.

And it feels like no matter how hard I try I'm never able to beat the people around me at the game. All of my friends just end up being better than me. And smash has been very close to me my whole life because its helped me get through some ough patches. I've had some shitty friends in the past that would take it to far and compare my smash skills to other things I've failed at in life, and for some reason it just really got to me over the years and has formed a big complex.

Then I get even angrier because I got angry in the first place not realizing I can't control the actions of another.

He's also very impatient and I'm very scared of his reaction if I am late for something. He also recently took out his anger on his cat (whom he loves a lot) by throwing him in the air a bit and rubbing the kitty's cheeks too hard after his cat bit him. It was too harsh and I'm pretty sure the cat was physically  hurt. He definitely acted on his anger. He loves his cat but thinks that he had to show the cat ""who's the boss"". This really bothers me as I believe we should be gentle with animals. 

I am contemplating breaking up with him because of the cat situation, I can't find a way to accept the behaviour as he doesn't negate the possibility of this happening again if his cat bites him again.

Once I snap at them, I catch myself, realize that I'm snapping at them, but continue going because I'm just so angry about what they have said.

It's always about something to do with a topic heavy in our current ""societal"" narrative; like someone digging in their heals about something racist, or telling me their opinions about why vaccines aren't to be trusted. I think the common thread is that it's always topics that seem to be heavy in the media over the last year.

I don't want to feel so reactive to these things. But I do feel deeply about them. How do I separate feeling deeply with being so reactive? Why do I care so much? I don't think I should care so much -- people are entitled to their opinions, as ultimately my reaction is based on my opinion.

And no matter how much and hard I get back to them and take revenge it always seems not enough after a while, and I seem to be still mad at times. I have never done anything remotely illegal nd would never do so, but I need to deal with my anger and hurt ego somehow because it is damaging to me.  


I also recognize I have a general and wider anger problem, and I think when a revenge comes around it is just a new vent to throw the anger I had beforehand in that direction.Revenge is never enough, still angry, even angrier with time I very, very rarely am in a position when someone betrays me and I seek revenge. Last time, I took it again, and again, and again. And again. Nothing illegal included: no fighting, no scene making, no nudes uploading (that's lame on so many levels.) I know I have a problem and actually suffer because of this other person. I need to somehow move on and write off this person and their betrayal. No matter how many times I get my revenge, I wouldn't be able to change the fact that they did me wrong first, they funked me up.

5. She never listens, when I don't want to do or eat something, she still does it.

I am terrified that something outside of the house will push me to the edge and they will do something like making an annoying sound (that isn't bad at all because kids do that) or my wife does that one thing that gets under my skin (also not bad just a personality trope for her)  and I will explode on them. I fear that my wife won't be able to get through to me. I do a good job not letting my anger get out of hand right now. But I am worried about the chance of my not being able to keep it under control. 

I guess without sounding any more ranty than it is. If someone has experience with something similar, how do you handle it? I know everyone is different. But if I hear how others might handle something like this I might be able to get a couple more tools to add to my book. 

Again, I am sorry if this is a rant. If it's not allowed on this page feel free to take it down, there will be no hard feelings here.",373

Maybe I'm becoming a disillusioned idealist, I don't know. 9 out of 10 days I don't feel this way, but once in a while this dark and vile feeling comes over me after consuming alcohol (especially whiskey) and I enter a downward spiral towards a path of destruction (be it vandalism or self-harm)

I had professional help and it helped until a switch in psychologists happened and I got labeled with a murderous rage after which I didn't want to go back. I really don't know what to do or how to talk about it, let alone break the current spiral I'm in. I feel so alone right now.",215

But I've been seeing them for almost 2 years now and I'm honestly feeling very little progress on the anger.

I'm currently seeing a government funded therapist, and while she is great, I feel like we kinda keep going in circles lately, like she might have run out of things to help me with for anger. Should I maybe seek another therapist? Would I get better results if I found a paid therapist maybe?

I thought reading and writing could help me vent but it only worked in the short term. I began reading philosophy and the endless rabbit holes it takes you down so I could think about something that wasn't the way I was fucking assaulted for once but I just can't do it.

I tried expressing through music but it's not enough, like releasing the most tiny piece of pressure from Yellowstone. I tried being more social around my male friends but they always bring something up that makes me think of what happened. I know they have no ill intent but I can't stop that feeling.

I will instead be frustrated by things, but no anger like I used to feel.

My anger came to (another) head this weekend after the pipes in my house almost froze completely. My wife was on the couch and I was left with nothing but a powerless feeling. Seemed everything I did that was said to do in the situation made it worse for my pipes. 

This lead to lots of door slams and useless screaming. I'm also coming down off nicotine for the past few weeks. I pretty much quit cold turkey after learning my wife is pregnant. 

I want to say that anger doesn't consume my life. I try to keep a level head in situations and others I just try and yell to blow my steam. But upsetting my wife while she's in her first few weeks of being pregnant is something I need to battle more urgently than ever. 

The reason for this post, is I got more angry than I have in years. When she got involved I got even more angrier because she wasn't understanding what was going wrong and why I was acting so frantically. I threw my hands up in anger and whacked my bathroom door and put a big ding in it. By doing that upset her more, understandably because I just broke our bathroom door. It's a flimsy hollow door so it wasn't like I put the might of God into it, but still, it's the fact that my anger resulted in that. 

We can't really afford to do weekly counseling and was wondering if there are online resources, or good apps that'll be good to use for anger? Maybe even a situational check list like walking away and how to prevent this from ever happening again.

I'm halfway through my telehealth therapy session and I hear knocking on the door. For a few minutes. I am 30 minutes into discussing my brother's death with my therapist, and the maintenance won't stop knocking. I excuse myself, go to the door, and said: ""guys, I'm in therapy! I requested 10:45 or later."" They said they'd come back.

But then I lost it. I closed the front door, then started wailing at the wall. I gave the wall about 10 hard punches. I haven't punched a wall or door in so long. I thought I was healing. Then I had to walk back to the living room and finish my therapy session. What a nightmare.

I made a real point of explaining to my SO how I felt and celebrating it. Normally I think the temptation would be to just act cool, like it was no big deal. ""I just know how to fix computers"" etc.

Thought I'd share that when we are taught to hide emotions, we often hide the good feelings too.Celebrating positive outcomes without patronising myself? This weekend, without going into loads of detail, I encountered a situation that absolutely would have triggered me in the past. I've been really trying to overcome these outburst of anger that have plagued me since I was a child. Even going to see a therapist a few times earlier in this year.

In short, I dropped something and stuff went all over the kitchen while my SO was preparing dinner for their family who were about to arrive. Instead I managed catch my behaviour and stay calm enough to tidy up without making a scene and upsetting my SO. I then withdrew for a few minutes to go play guitar and calm myself down.

I'm really proud of myself over this episode. But can't articulate this to my SO without it sounding like a child who wants patting on the top of the head, simply for behaving like a normal person. I think just posting here might help. There is a way to get out of the anger loop sometimes.",349
564,Anger_565,Slimebubby,Anger,"HELP: Huge relapse after thinking I had beat it. Was having a good day, actually out working on something positive. This angry middle aged man comes up looking to pick a fight and says something confrontational, how he was going to destroy the art I was putting up. 

Out of nowhere I went from having a good day to being the most angry, disgusting, rage filled person. Just like that, I allowed someone else to bring my anger from 0 to 100.

I've worked on my anger for years now (by myself) and thought I beat it, because I've gotten to the point where if I have an argument with someone I can be calm and rational, dial it back, instead of blowing up on the other person.

Then today I have the biggest relapse, I got so into it with this guy, it kept escalating and I said the worst things I have ever said while losing control. It's very difficult for me to work on this problem where if someone comes up to me and does what I consider bullying, my anger goes from 0 to 100. It's not an every day situation, it's a once every 6 months possibly longer situation, and when it comes around I consistently fail every single time.

I am so embarrassed and disappointed in myself. I seriously thought I was in a better place and this was behind me, then this happens. 

I know I could have said ""Alright man, have a good day"" and just thought about how miserable this guy must be to pick a fight with someone working on art, I understand the logic, but how can I control this rage feeling that comes out of nowhere and completely takes control of me in less than a second during situations like this?",342

566,Anger_567,throwaway-ravn,Anger,"Why do I never change, even when I take intiative to change? I suffer from an illness called IED (Intermediate Explosive Disorder) which causes me to have very uncontrollable anger. It is evident from pasts outbursts or episodes that I tend to harm others or destroy property which shows how bad it is. I also suffer from ADD and ADHD as well. During my episodes I would decide to justify what I did wrong was right because of how argumentative I could get or that I am too engulfed with vengeance or rage to think. When I become calmer I start to think more rational and understand that what I did was wrong, this would only bring more pain because I would start to feel regret or guilt because I understood I did something wrong which then I would feel very critical of myself. This would in turn, cause me to learn from my mistakes and take intiative to be a better person. When I do ""change"" it would only last for a few months before I get another emotional outburst and then I go back to the same ""bad"" person I was before, for further explanation this would cause me to lose hope as I realize I that my efforts to become a better person would be put to waste and I always get told by people that I ""never change"" or I'm stuck in a ""pattern"" causing me to lose more hopes of ever becoming a better person, which then kept me at being my old self until someone or a future outburst will give me an intiative to change, thus beginning the cycle again as the change would only last for a short time.

I also take mood stabilizers daily from a supportive team of psychologists and therapists so don't worry if I need to get help, I already have them.

I am not sure if this is self improvement or anger management, but my ""change"" is centered around trying to manage my anger and preventing harm or self harm.

I apologize if my question and context has been so negative, I do not mean to ruin anyone's day/mood.",397
567,Anger_568,justanotherdude836,Anger,"Why do I only have outbursts around family. I'm posting here because I'm worried at how my anger can affect my future relationships if it persists. When I'm away at college or around friends, every describes me as very calm, put together, even meditative. I feel very calm in public and can handle confrontation very well. I've met people outside my family that did things that I think most people would have a much much adverse reaction towards, but I was able to keep calm and not let my emotions get the best of me. But at home, I feel like I get angry so much more often. It's not by any means frequent, but the only time I have outbursts are at home. My responses are often very disproportionate to the cause. I yell and can appear very aggressive even though I'd never do anything physical. And while I really hate to say it, yelling almost feels cathartic. I've developed other outlets like exercise and writing so that I can control my emotions. I usually pour almost all my emotions and energy into work or exercise, but it almost seems a bit extreme with how much work and exercise I do to control my emotions. My family is lovely, and while we occasionally argue, I'd by no means say that this is their fault. I just don't get why these outbursts only happen around them. I don't want to be in a relationship and think I can handle my emotions and have an outburst like this. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.",299

Like you feel impotent because you know you are right about something and the other one, just doesn't get it. Do you get mad at someone's else mistakes that you know you wouldn't make?

I do, sometimes.Im hurting people around me Im 26yo. My gf recently broke up with me.
We had both really toxic behaviour.
I lost it and I hit her, I regret it 5 minutes after.
We broke up more than a dozen times till she finally left.

I have a daughter, she's five. I yell at her for every little mistake she makes.

Similar with my parents.

572,Anger_573,JustKxtana,Anger,"Idk what's wrong with me at this point. When I was 14, I was very insecure, thus I subconsciously  made anger as my defense mechanism. Almost everyday I get angry and talked back to my parents who were very shocked with my change of attitude as they know me for not talking back.

When I was 15, I lost some acquaintances, because when I get stressed, I gat angry and yell at them a lot.

Now 16, I can't even manage to speak without sounding angry. I get annoyed by every little thing, and I feel like I've just become very toxic overall. I'd get angry when somebody is crying, complaining, etc. and I bottle everything up inside. It's not that I don't keep my composure, because I honestly try my best to do so. But even then, when I think I have it all under control, I blurt it all out when my bottle is full. It ends up hurting the people around me, when I'm sure they just wanted to be reassured and comforted. But I've come to know that myself doesn't really allow that. She can't comfort or reassure people around her because the only thing she knows is anger. When I'm giving advice, It's almost always in an angry tone and most often I'm honestly pissed off and feel bothered. However, I do get guilty sometimes, and that results to me hating myself more, feeling stressed, and gets angry all over again. I'm worried I will end up physically hurting myself or the people around me and that's the reason why I'm trying to vent.

I have a particular thing about emotional manipulation. It triggers me due to past abuse, and usually it's a very easy way to get a rise out of me. In the past, I would start saying some vicious and even threatening things back just to shut them up. But I can't be that man anymore. I have to have standards now, even if the person across from me doesn't. 

So when they started running through all the standard narcissist's tricks - guilt tripping, victim carding, ""you're the only one"" - I simply sat back, put on some music, and let them talk themselves dry. Funny thing about these people is they aren't very creative and have almost no self awareness. They repeat themselves a lot and give up their own game, and once you're onto them, they stop being threatening and just start looking...kind of sad. And not worth your time. 

So I walked away from that relationship for good. No fights. No screaming matches. Just a short and simple goodbye. And it feels good. I used to think rage gave me power, but from the outside all I looked like was a giant toddler. This, though? Now *this* is podracing.

I had for just 1 year and on Christmas day at my grandparents while we were at a neighbors my mum went to check on her. Lucy ran out to find dad and I. Mum was never close to Lucy so she would normally just run past mum. And while running across the road a car ran over her and then drove off leaving my 11 year old self and dad to walk outside and see Lucy's body and guts. It was incredibly traumatizing as a child. And after that I just isolated myself for many years from the world leading to anxiety, depression.

I wish I could find out who ran over my dog. Cause I won't lie. If I ever do. I'll probably beat the shit out of them. I really for many years have wanted to. Every-time I remember something good in my life I remember that. I dont try to remember it but it always comes into my memory as a child. I wish with my whole existence I could find out who did it.

Things have cooled down on that front as the COVID situation gets better, but I find myself still becoming quickly angry if I misinterpret her tone about something, really just anything, or really I guess just if I am not getting the reaction from her that I want. I don't want her to agree with me always, it's just the way that she says things sometimes. Sure I would like to agree most of the time, and we generally do, but I don't realize until AFTER I've been mean, rude, and argumentative that I was wrong. It's like I go into a different state of mind and only realize that I was being an asshole after she starts getting upset and then I deeply regret it.

I think the argument started due to stress from school and a 3 hour activity that I felt pressured to do, since my mom paid for it. Essentially my mom was bugging me about how I was working slowly on my essay, and we argued about how I felt that I was pressured to do something she paid for, and she felt that I should have just said no and not made promises to do something I wasn't able to do.

a few questions

1. Right now i have no idea what to do since I actually broke something this time. This has never happened before and I'm a bit scared of myself.
2. How do I deal with anger? The event scared me and I looked all over google for coping techniques, but my searching hasn't been too productive. I'll see something that says ""Don't bottle up your anger, express it"" but the same page will say ""Don't act on your anger."" I really want to prevent this from happening again but idk how. Before this, I always just took deep breaths to try to make the feeling go away, but now I don't feel like I'm in control.

also not entirely related, but im feeling kinda depressed after the incident, which might be a byproduct of all the anger

I am VERY LUCKY to have never faced legal consequences for my actions, but have ran from the police on multiple occasions due to my actions. My knuckles are mostly deformed from years of punching shit I shouldn't, and I have injured myself so many times due to outbursts I couldn't even begin to count. Severe lacerations, broken bones, head injuries, all painful and all numerous. I have been called an asshole, a criminal, a psychopath, and have been told I'll likely be in jail for murder one day. One of the biggest memories I have was a teacher and a group of classmates sitting me down in the 4th grade to tell me that I would eventually see the inside of a jail. I feel that society has 100 percent failed me in terms of opportunities for treatment, support, or rehabilitation, as the stigma for those like me remains strong. This is my greatest personal battle that I have fought alone with no support, no treatment, and no clear progress.

I didn't know what to say or do in the moment and I was desperately trying to convince them it wasn't only a one sided problem but I started getting really agitated and it's like my brain had an roadblock because all I could do was sit there and practically conjugate the same reply over and over and get a less than reciprocated response.. I felt even more like a dumbass. Essentially I'm the asshole now since I not only couldn't talk due to the rage I was experiencing at the moment and I stuttered and sounded like a damn idiot.

To not be a passenger or hostage on a really fucked up ride.

But it's so fucking toxic.  Definitely feel it take a toll on health.  And it's certainly not good on the vocal cords to yell until you can only whisper in traffic.  But idk, maybe it's worth being mad.  Maybe it's better than sadness.  I don't know anymore.

A couple of years ago I was in a toxic relationship. But at the time I thought it was fine. I didn't ask for advice or reach out to friends anymore I was satisfied with my first girlfriend. Except I slowly stopped reaching out the my friends as it was going on.

Then I reached out to one of my good friends, who had good relationship experience. He gave me advice to keep the relationship going. It went well until it wasn't. When it ended I went into a mental breakdown and nobody was there for me.

I started blaming my friend who gave me advice. He was judging me for choosing to date this girl. He then elaborated and explained how I had alienated myself from our friend group. I had been accusing them of not reaching out to me enough, which was a legit concern for me. 

After this interaction I grew distant from that friend and others. I think they were talking about me behind my back. I had also gotten arrested so I'm sure people were thinking negatively of me. Every time I reached out to my one friend, he kept bringing up how I put him down (which I admit) but he wouldn't let things go.

Instead I had to work with these two assholes all season. At first I tried to be friendly with them because I didn't want the work place to be uncomfortable.

Now I look back, and wish I had just let it all out on those guys. I'm angry for how they treated me. The issue is with them and not me. That was not leadership they showed but a lack of intelligence which lead to them being disrespectful . They were angry about other things and took it out on me. I was a lesser on the social hierarchy, and they took advantage of it. 

Tired of feeling angry of that shit I had to endure. I took too much; I didn't say enough back, and most importantly I didn't walk away from that job. I reflect on the moments of telling them to fuck off which ease my anger, but man do I just want to look past this.

When we went to meet up with her friends I stood there for 10 minutes awkwardly and she just ignored introducing me to them until some lady was like who is this guy. Finally I got frustrated and told her what was upsetting me saying I just wanted to spend time with her. Yet she couldn't listen to me saying that she just kept going off on what she thought I needed and it just kept escalating me till I was yelling in a hotel lobby. I left and calmed down when I was calming down she was already up my ass for an apology that I gave her but it's never good enough. She kept going off on me when she got back to our place. Told me she was sleeping on the couch then 10 minutes later she's flipping out on me because I'm not sleeping on the couch and I said well you said you where going to. Mind you I payed for the place we are staying. She then keeps blowing up at me yelling and threatening me when I'm trying to stay calm and not lose my cool. I just don't know how to stay calm and get my point across to her or when I am calm I can't get my point across. How do I deal with my anger when the person I'm trying to talk to won't listen to anything I'm saying.,312

I constantly endure verbal abuse on a daily basis and to keep myself sane I just pretend I'm not pissed but it's getting really hard to do that.

I was used to channeling my anger and doing productive work. Even as a kid, if I needed to get a job done I was making myself furious so that I was doing that job in a breeze.

Now for the last two years, I worked on my anger issues. And I cant seem to get angry about anything anymore, whenever I feel like I am getting angry it just passes by me automatically saying stuff like ""maybe they have a different side to that story"" etc. I dont have any anger to channel and since it was my only way to be productive, I have no idea how to be productive anymore.

That's not to say that everything pisses me off, and I'm above average and remaining emotionless to normally irritating stimuli, but the times I do get mad are over incredibly tiny incidents or pet peeves. Anyway, this is the part I find a bit weird: the anger manifests as a boiling rage that makes me want to lash out physically, but for every ounce of anger poured in, there's also an ounce of tranquility that matches it until I feel that the anger, albeit suppressed and will not be acted upon, is boiling under the surface and putting my mind through a duality of sorts. Feeling so conflicted (equal parts rage and calm) has me scratching at myself, wanting to pull my hair out, or feeling some of self-destructive stimuli to take my mind away from how there's two opposite emotions pulling me in different directions. I'd compare it to sensory overload when it gets this way. What's wrong with me, and what can I even do?",228

My SO has pointed out that I have a temper, and I know I do. I get flustered easily and start to get angry. My outbursts typically consist of cursing (excessive use of f***) and raising my voice. It's usually over something stupid too, like cleaning, car stuff, work stuff, you know, things that happen normally and people can handle without regressing to toddler behavior.

I have been working on communicating that I'm in a bad mood or not in the mood for joking around because I'm frustrated. My partner has even noted that I have been better at communicating this and that my outbursts have lessened. 

But I just want to be able to communicate my thoughts verbally without doing this and I ultimately want to be the best partner I can to him.I love him, and he is always open and honest with me about when I'm out of line with my anger. I want to be a better person and learn how to manage this.

Then, they just started going across the kitchen and by reflex I grabbed their wrist, accidentally squeezing too hard. They said their wrist was red and it kind of hurt. Lo and behold someone else comes down and they repeat it like 7 times over, with a joke here and there. I just get annoyed sometimes when people repeat over and over, but something about the content of it somewhat scaring me that it could make the other person be afraid of me just pushed me to snapping. I crushed the can in my hand and I just hear one of the most infuriating phrases I ever hear from that one person alone. ""That's not normal"", as if someone who never deals with my kind of anger ever would understand the feeling of it. I threw the can as hard as I could into my recycling bin and just yelled for them to shut up and stormed up stairs.

These actions are impacting my relationships with those I love the most.  

&amp;#x200B;

A small example without too much details. I was hanging out with my ex-girlfriend (whom we are both discussing and are confident will be getting back together. dependent on me dealing with these issues appropriately). I know that she is seeing other men at this point and I've accepted that and hold no resentment towards her. However, I was filming something for her on her phone and saw a text from another guy that said something fairly innocent. However, as soon as I saw it just a feeling overcame me and my response was a change in tone reading the message to her in a snide tone and just dropping the phone. Immediately after I realize my response was pointless and I calm down but the damage of the reaction is done.  This is just a small example but often they can build up to much larger reactions (never physical). I love her very much and only want the best for her and for us to have any chance I have to learn to deal with these reactions.

Currently I attend counseling , psychology and practice meditation which I'm seeing a great improvement from my outlook on life, my mindset and these reactions. However, I was hoping others may have some tips or advice on how to control these reactions before they occur.",303

I try a lot to make sure that I'm not bringing things up which trigger him. Since mid December, we've ended up living in the same area which will last for the next few days. So we meet in the evenings for walks or for a snack. Today, he was extremely low and irritated about the stuff happening in his life and I interrupted to show something that might cheer him up. He got really annoyed with me for changing the topic and pushed me lightly (not violently at all), got extremely upset and started walking quickly (almost stormed off) in the other direction and said he didn't wanna talk to me at all and wants to just head back to his place. He calmed down after a while and got upset and apologized to me for getting annoyed. I told him that it's okay and reassured that things will be fine. 

Despite knowing that outbursts make him do and say things he doesn't mean, I did feel alarmed and a bit upset. I'm doing okay now, but I want to deal with it better and really help him come out of this.

Like I feel this fight is so stupid, why am I angry, it wasn't even a big deal anyway sorts of laugh. The surge of anger is very sudden in me and like the moment when you're fighting and things become funny, something like that. My anger scares me and I feel like breaking away with my boyfriend because of that. I feel like saying that he deserves better.

""The Zen response would be that you laugh when you are extremely angry because it's your ego that promotes the anger but subconsciously you realize the powerlessness and absurdity of anger.""

I read this somewhere and relate to it. Like this is what happens. In that moment, I just realize what a dumb thing is making me angry. Why do I feel this way?",311
701,Anger_702,Reasonable-Tea-7470,Anger,"How to deal with blind rage when triggered? I'm easy going most of the time and rarely get mad at other people, but when I'm triggered I have no control of myself. It feels like a reflex or an impulse. Once I'm past a tipping point there's no stopping. I usually need to scream and throw or smash something. I will occasionally get on a ball in the floor screaming or crying and my entire body tenses up, trying not to punch the floor or wall. Sometimes if I'm in the car I'll drive fast.

My new favorite thing to do is throw or smash my phone screen...obviously not ideal...

My trigger is usually just seeing or thinking about happy couples. Mentally I'm happy for them and don't hate spending time by myself, I'm pretty used to it, but the pain of having been alone for so long is so intense. It's hard to explain. I'm not mad AT anything or anyone, it's the most extreme expression of the highest levels of emotional pain. This only really happens when I'm alone I guess, so it's not like I can ""just leave/walk away."" And since it's situational and not generalized, I can't necessarily just stop whatever I'm doing and go to the gym or for a run or something. It's like a 2 minute burst, then I'm usually feeling sad afterwards.

There's no rhyme or reason to it, so it's really hard to figure out, but it completely hijacks my brain in the moment and I smash shit, so I would really like to stop. 

People and situations don't really get me mad at all. I'm really bad at being mad. It is certainly the most stressful emotion for me to deal with. Please help :(",353

I am writing this pretty much right after it happend the last time...

So basically I get very, very fking aggressive, when I do not understand or solve some conceptuality/problem by given information pretty much immediately.

That has been rare of an occurance up until now, luckily and sadly, so that I have absolutely no clue how to tackle the anger resulting from it, if that happens. I am too stupid by emotional intelligence to do so without help I guess. And the adrenaline is killing my ability to think properly for a good amount of time.  


Even worse is the anger I have about the people or sources behind it, if I eventually get it and it just so  happens to be the case that you realize the given information by some source or explanation was simply so braindead stupid or insufficient that I am convinced that anybody would've been incapable of understanding it, except if the knowledge supposed to be transmitted was known already.

I find it especially hard to cope with this bs, because I am actually not an emotional person by any means whatsoever. The rare times I actually get emotional I am pretty overwhelmed as for what to do about emotions. I'd prefer just to have an emotion switch I can turn off for studying. Maybe Elon Musks gonna provide something like that some day, would certainly buy.

Any time I get any amount of annoyed with her behavior she acts like a had a full freak out when in reality I just slightly raise my voice when explaining why I'm upset with her. She has childhood trauma that makes her very sensitive to the point that any type of altercation can trigger her in to extreme anxiety.

She wanted me to see a therapist. I went several times but he mostly focused on talking about her drinking problem and how to deal with it, didn't seem to think I have an angrer problem. I stopped going after he eluded to me not really needing his service as he focuses on clients with more extreme psychological issues.

She does things that are very annoying aside from the drinking problem. Doesn't close cupboards. Ever. Will not put the lid on any container in the fridge. Will not close the door to the house.  It's like she has a legit mental deficiency where she cannot close things and I can't even make a sandwich without getting irritated because every lid in the fridge is off of everything.

Around the one year mark, we started getting into this bad habit of fighting that pretty much boils down to the WAY we get angry. 

My girlfriend has a very short fuse. She's not easily angry but do the right thing and you're on her bad side for the rest of the night. It's like once she gets agitated she shuts herself out. There's nothing anybody can say or do to change it and if they can it'll take an immense amount of time and it usually gets worse before it gets better. She loses all sense of herself and is driven by her anger to say/do things that she doesn't mean. And reasoning with her will get you no where. She's a tough case to crack and is a lady of few words. 

Unfortunately my anger stems from disrespect, ungrateful acts and belittling, so her shutting herself out from me when she's angry and only responding with attitude, it triggers me and it usually just sends things spiraling. 

I want to help her get control of her anger but I also wanna find out a better way to handle her anger, the best way possible, besides spending hours trying to talk sense into her.

And now I'm am adult (I definitely don't feel like one) and I realized that the only reason I was able to ignore my trauma is because I strongly believed that everything would be better after I graduated, moved out and began my new college life.

I'm looking for some advice as to how I can be more calm when driving and be more patient when I encounter things like this on the road. Do you guys have any tips on managing road rage?

Thank you!",188

First said it was ADHD, and I was like kay,,,then accepted that anger was not adhd. Nor was it any other mental health label, it is anger. Then I became to accepting to my own truth that our relationship was not a toxic one, it was a verbally, emotionally, physically abusive relationship bc of his behaviors. Bc of my own traumas of sexual assault, I was in a sad sacred place, becoming numb to life, which was extra hard during the isolation of covid and moving to a new city for 'our relationship'. Leaving the relationship was liberating and I am feeling whole again, also in part bc of vaxx life allowing up to be more social.   


I have deep complex beliefs that all people can heal, and also that we as individuals are responsible for anyone elses healing. I also believe that time and community are the greatest healers.

I can't remember the last time I acted on my anger, probably in my teens.

At some point I learned to manage myself but ever since I notice something strange, specifically when somebody begins to really annoy me (I would say my threshold for annoyance if high). I will often imagine myself hurting them, most of the time this happens after the fact. During whatever situation I find myself spiralling from irritable to anger, I feel as if my brain is a mass of flies buzzing and crawling all over eachother. This is usually accompanied by some really odd movement I can't really stop myself from making. This usually involves constrained bearing of teeth, a conflicted feeling between closing my eyes and forcing them open, fidgeting (normal for me) becomes forceful to the point where I've hurt myself.

806,Anger_807,purvapalsra,Anger,"The Stifling Technique for Anger management 

The word stifling means to feel unable to breathe, or to make somebody unable to breathe.This is my method for dealing with an unwelcomed situation in which you are having an argument and your anger is consuming you.I've heard of many techniques in which you're supposed to breathe in and out and be mindful of your thoughts. However, none of them appear to work in the heat of the moment.

So, what do I do when my anger and ego mind tries to take control of me?

‚Ä¢At that point, I freeze, _stop breathing, and hold it until I feel like giving up._ When a person stops breathing, the lack of oxygen causes them to _become disoriented or inebriated._

‚Ä¢As a result, the mind _becomes foggy and switches to this feeling._ The involuntary nervous system finally takes over and _breathing resumes._

‚Ä¢When _I hold my breath,_ I imagine that the _anger is bottled up inside me and that as I exhale, it will be expelled_.Because your brain desperately needs oxygen, it knocks you out and causes you to start _breathing deeply_.

‚Ä¢As I start taking deep breaths, I remind myself, _""Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned.""_ 

‚Ä¢Whenever I get back my breath, I feel grateful for it. A gentle reminder, be thankful for each and every breath you take.

*After that, sit with your anger and delve deeper into its causes and as where it originated.* As Budha qouted _""Do not look for a sanctuary in anyone except your self""_ Furthermore, if you believe that regulating your breath can cause you to die, you are mistaken.

Sometimes these bursts of anger and anxiety can be brought on by things such as not wanting to be outside because it's hot, even though my friends and family want to, or by even lesser things. Other times lack or sex or things of the sort, and just rough days at work.

Now, however, I have realized that I have to deal with these emotions in order to have a good life, but due to the emotional development I've described, I tend to express my anger in outbursts of shouting and pushing people away, especially in the case of my SO who has grown up with an abusive mother, so that when I shout I remind my SO of her mother shouting at her, so it is affecting her in a negative way. I just feel like my whole life I've had to suppress my emotions, and now that I try to deal with them, I end up hurting the one I love so that I have to suppress them again.

850,Anger_851,dvorakq,Anger,"How can I learn to let my anger fuel me without it controlling me?      I hope this is the right place to post this, but I think I'm just looking for advice on how I can feel my anger without letting it control me. Basically when I was a kid I was soooo angry all the time. I grew up bullied and abused by my family and I let it out. Oftentimes really violently. I hit family members, friends, broke things, hurt myself, ect. It's not that I didn't have empathy for the people around me, it's that even if I knew that I hurt them it didn't matter. But then in my sophomore year of high school I was having a stupid argument with my friend and I hit them, and that was the first time I felt horribly guilty for what I done hurting someone I loved like that. I really learned that if I felt anger I could never let it out, running away from it was going to be the first and only response from now on. So now even when a horrible things happen in the world, or people really hurt me, I can't feel it. I just let people walk all over me. I can't express that part of me, it's like a mental block. If I feel it again, I'm going to get violent, and if I let that happen I'm a horrible person. It feels incredibly demotivating and stressful, plus I don't want to be the kind of person that gets angry like that, but it feels like I'm going to have to learn to start moving my life forward again. Idk any resources or advice would be appreciated.",329

Im talking about when I was 10 I chased my sister around the house with a running chainsaw and when she locked herself in a room I went after the door with the chainsaw. The sad thing is, that wasn't even an uncommon occurence in my house. My parents were hardly ever home and my sister is a maniac bipolar that had drug and alcohol issues so she was unpredictable and would antagonize me and my brother a lot. In my house hold you had to defend yourself or my sister would pummel you into next week.

Half of the time, im not even sure why I get stressed and angry so easily because Im only 21 and I have a really good job, I own my own house, and go to a good college so it's not like im struggling to keep food on my table or pay my bills.

So now I'm upset and really wanted to throw everything away and my mom is telling me ""it's ok"" and ""calm down it's not a big deal"" and asking ""why are you so mad"". I thought I'll just leave it in there longer and now it's burnt on top and still not browned underneath. It's not my house it's not my oven, my mom doesn't care to get it fixed. But they rely on me to make the dinner every day so the least they could do is get it fixed. She said no because it's a hassle. How am I supposed to use that small ass oven that doesn't even heat evenly to cook for 4-5 people every day.

I think maybe part of my problem is that I don't usually confront people about why I'm angry or vent about it to anyone (because I think I'm annoying since I dwell on it and could go on and on about it) and I just bottle it up and obsess over it with myself, even if its small. For instance, like over a week ago I was eating a snack (like 5 crackers with peanut butter on them) and the 2 people I'm eating with are eating like a whole meal so I obviously  finish my small snack before they finish eating and then they start saying how fast I ate and how hungry I was and it just became a conversation on how i was eating. Just typing this is pissing me off LMAO but it just made me so fucking mad because 1. why are you even commenting on how/what I'm eating?  and 2. it's a small snack so how slow should i eat it?

He is very frequently on edge and a lot of things trigger him into an angry mood. He always says that is just the way he is and how he talks, and/or justifies his behavior by either saying others behave worse or that his behavior is the fault of others. 

He has had moments of clarity, too, where he apologizes and understands that he needs to tackle his anger problem. We have talked about a strategy to de-escalate his anger but he doesn't use it. I am the only one who does but that is not enough. 

Especially at night, at weekends when he drinks he becomes rageful, like monologuing and talking by himself angrily but at others, of course, who are not there. I have used the strategy to remove myself from the situation and tell him that I'm going to go to bed and that's what I do. But if somebody dares to cross his path when he is in that state he will immediately criticize, mock or insult them. It seems like such an automatic reaction, it is weird and I don't understand it.

Is he even thinking when he acts like this? How is such behavior benefitial for him or for others?

Now with the pandemic and that he has lost his job, I feel like walking on egg shells. Like if I do something that he labels as somehow negative, he will get at least slightly angry. His behavior and feelings are not my responsibility but I also don't want to be on edge all time.

Nowadays I'm most relaxed when he is sleeping or when we are watching a movie to go to sleep.

I've been smoking weed daily for almost 12 years, and today I realized that I use it to tone down angry thoughts and feelings. Not sadness, not boredom, just anger. I turn into a massive cunt if I don't smoke, not because of a traditional sense of addiction, but because I've always been angry, bitter and jealous. On the rare occasions when I stop smoking for a few weeks, I get irrationally anger at everything, from the state of the world to small road inconveniences. 

I think this anger comes from lack of self acceptance. The things I label as ""cringe"" are probably the things that I dislike about myself, things I simply can't accept for one reason or another. I'm struggling to stop smoking, tried to quit hundreds of time, and I'm now realising that part of the reason I always end up back to the devil's lettuce is that I can't deal with inevitable RAGE that comes when I'm fully aware of myself and my surroundings. 

Damn, it felt good to put this into words. Anyone else smoke weed primarily to escape from this angry mindset?",248

My anger/anxiety would manifest itself in ripping clothes initially but it has progressed to destroying things around the house. The past two weeks have been really hard for me emotionally. On top of that I developed a phobia regarding buttoned shirts because I have ripped button shirts before. I have to go to work tomorrow. For most people, they would be looking forward to that. But for me, it fills me with more anxiety and dread because of what I mentioned before. In the past I have resorted to occupying my hands with objects so I won't be able to rip.

881,Anger_882,mel_rose78,Anger,"Anger caused by possible ADHD? I have been getting to know a 44/m for the past 5 months. He has freely admitted he has anger issues. It has previously resulted in 3 months in jail.
Last week on the phone I made a few suggestions eg the food he has bought for his new pup, dealing with a puppy when trying to park car n pup doesn't move lol and how to find a good vet.
All this was done in the greatest not intentions. But he didn't see it like that. He felt I was being bossy n playing counselor.
Got so angry get used a few choice words n hung up.
This isn't the first time he's over reacted. And a think a lot comes down to his own low self esteem.
But when looking into it, I can't help but wonder if he has undiagnosed ADHD. Is there anyone that has it that may be able to give advice?
He and I stopped talking. I got quite upset n a couple of days later, after texting him I wasn't trying to tell him what to do etc(and receiving no response) basically told him I was over it. I felt like I held little worth to him. For him to not even say sorry after the fact? Hell, I apologized for how he felt. Explained that wasn't my intention.

So sad I've possibly lost him out of my life
 I always thought we would always stay friends. But he's totally walls up. Only messaged I've received is ""I know what you mean"" when I expressed my sadness on losing a friendship. I get the impression he's felt abandoned his whole life n don't want him to feel that, but maybe I just need to walk away. What more can I do?

I know even if I suggest anger management (which he was going to do before covid hit) he will yet again think I'm playing counselor üò≠",378
882,Anger_883,StopLookingBuy,Anger,"I don't feel bad for getting angry, I DO feel bad about how destructive I am while angry. Anger is a natural emotion I guess and people do a good job of pissing each other off so I don't beat myself up for getting upset. However the lengths that I will go when angry are just ridiculous. It is like I slip into a split personality. I'm normally a guy that is always focusing on improving myself and keeping my attitude up but when I'm angry it goes completely out of the window. I say the worst hurtful things, I try to intimidate physically, I break things,  I used to punch things. I just become incensed. Then after I see I've hurt someone I start look around at all the damage I caused then the shame and regret kick in. My body feels horrible and usually unable sleep that night. You can imagine how that's a big issue when it was happening everyday at one time. 

I just don't feel like other people go to these far out places like I do. The way I react, I would say is more like if I was in a life or death scenario. I never act that way to strangers. It's usually always around people Im close to. I have cursed someone out on my phone in line at the store but i typically don't like strangers see me when I'm mad to not be thought of as a psycho or scary",279
883,Anger_884,llllllllllIIllll,Anger,"Conditions for getting Angry There are two sets of Feelings for getting Angry

&amp;#x200B;

1) first Set depends on Concentrating Hard, Hot, Tight feelings in Muscles of Abdomen, especially the 

frontal ones 

&amp;#x200B;

2) second Set depends on Concentrating Hard, Tight feelings in Muscles of Upper Thighs while Hot 

feeling remains at Abdomen

&amp;#x200B;

In both cases, as the Hot Feeling begins to Rise in Direction Up, the Hard and Tight Feelings follow 

&amp;#x200B;

There are Versions of how these Feelings are Directionaly Moved    

 

A) Feelings are Moved towards Throat, you Yell as Loud as you Can from Top of your Lungs

B) Feelings are Moved towards your Shoulders and Down into your Hands, your Fists, you start 

Punching stuff ( or People ) until Anger Runs Out ( Into them ) 

C) Feelings are Moved towards your Back, and Down into your Legs, making you Run Away from 

Something or Someone, untill you're Far Enough Away or become too Tiered 

D) Feelings are Moved Up and then Invert interns of Direction 

D-1) You become Overwhelmingly Horny  

D-2) You become Overwhelmingly Shy, and Shy Away from Something ( While Still Moving    
Towards It )  

&amp;#x200B;

""So What?""

&amp;#x200B;

The only Question that's important, is ""How do you Manage to Build and Concentrate so much Fear?"" 

&amp;#x200B;

The kind of Food that you Eat sets material of the body and the Qualities of the Feelings. 

How you Align your Physical Body sets the Intensity of the Concentration. 

&amp;#x200B;

So if you eat the kind of food that makes your body Capture and Generate overwhelming amounts of 

Temperature, while at the same time Aligning your Physical Body such that you begin to Concentrate 

Fear in your Abdomen ( without Introducing any Movement of it )  then 

do Not be Surprised if you get Angry ( doesn't matter at what, or whom ).",386

I've always been a pretty moody person, but it has been getting worse, especially recently. I get mad pretty easily, but it's been getting way fucking easier to get me mad lately

I get so fucking mad at everyday things that shouldn't even bother me, like one time in class there was a question I wanted to answer, but the teacher called on one of my classmates instead of me. I got so angry, and for what? All I could think was things like ""fuck you"" or ""I hope you fall into a fucking well you bitch"" and other toxic thoughts like that.

Usually when I get pissed off (which is a lot) the first thing my mind jumps to is the classic death wish and a 'fuck you'. The anger usually doesn't last for that long, but it happens a lot. I don't know what to do.

I've never really expressed these feelings to others and I'm scared to do it. I don't want to tell my parents and I don't know why. Is something bad going to happen if I tell them? No. Then why not tell them? I don't know.",242

Point being I guess I'm ranting but also just seeing other point of views of things. But the Anger stems on her taking my best friend and my best friend sleeping with her like a slut. And beyond that towards the end of our relationship I tried hard to keep us going, and she just gave up and decided I'm gonna be a attention seeking slut. She did and it got so bad I dumped her because she was hurting me emotionally. To the point where my roommates had to hold me while I cried every night. It's been months now and I'm getting better but I just have so much anger and bitterness towards her. I'm 21 now she's 19 I think? But I was 19 and she was 17 when we started dating.

I went into work, and they have these awful computer panels that control the elevators and they don't work so well. I've been stressed a bit due to covid so my emotions are all out of whack... anyways... the hulk made his appearance and I punched the screen TWICE... breaking it. The next day the company whose building my job resides in sent the police to my home and had me arrested. And banned me from the site. I didn't get fired but you know... I gotta be there to do it. Thankfully my employer liked me enough to go to bat for me and as of today I'm allowed to go back to work.

But... how do I deal with this type of rage? Its not the first time I've broken something like that. When I was a kid I'd smash controllers, a few years ago during a bad breakup I punched a concrete wall so hard I broke my hand. I could go on..

I'd not consider myself an angry person, and its never people or animals that set me off- its inanimate objects that take the brunt of it. Or myself. When I was really depressed I beat my head until it looked like I lost a boxing match.

As part of that I have this continual feeling like I've been wronged and need to avenge myself. 
But the thing is ...there's not a specific target. Maybe it could relate to some past negative experiences. But there's no tangible target. Even if overgeneralize I still don't feel I can pinpoint it to any specific group. Really most of my issues have to do with underlying conditions that are no ones fault, the thinking patterns I've developed to survive and a small portion relates to being bullied as a child and ignored as an adult. 

The thing is I know there's nothing or no one I need to take revenge on like I said I can't even pin a target. But the feeling won't go away - it's been there for years and it's getting worse and I feel more and more like I need to take real action. 

My interpretation is that this anger is part letting go of the past and part me wanting to make changes now and being frustrated in the process. I want to move on ...but how? I can't seem to channel this energy positively and it's destroying me. I'm not worried I will hurt someone but I'm worried I might do other destructive things - quit my job cut off the few human connections I have, or just drown my bad feelings in food, drugs and bad choices.

And they've been going through some stuff so I tried to understand. But they finally messaged back after three days. And they've been leaving me on read for three hours now. When all I'm trying to do is be there for them. And it hurts. It's been happening more and more. And every time I try to be there for them within a timely manner, be understanding or support them, I feel blown off even more. I'm so tired of this.It hurts trying to be there for someone after they hurt you. And they blow you off. I misread their attraction as deeper feelings, sure. But they had a million opportunities to be more direct. To say: ""I don't want to hurt you because I might want a relationship down the line. But I can't date you."" But they didn't. And they are going through something hard, with it being the anniversary date of something really bad. But it's like they are mad at me because I ended the arrangement and taking it out on me. 

I can't tell anymore. It hurts when your friend and creative partner goes from talking to you everyday to leaving you on delivered. Especially when you try to support them. I can't tell if it's just this time of the year that's causing them to isolate. Or if it has to do with me as well. It really hurts when they message you after two days saying they need time, but ask if you'll be available the next evening to rehearse. And then they don't even read your message when you say you'll be available. I feel blown off. It's aggravating, feeling like I can't reach out because I know they need time. But feeling hated at the same time. 

It is such a dramatic shift in our dynamic and I don't know what to do about this. :/",395
910,Anger_911,SoftAlmond,Anger,"I'm on medication now and I've noticed that I don't really feel angry anymore. I used to have daily anger incidents where I would hit things but now I've noticed that ever since I started taking the medication it hasn't really happened, and the few times it has I just felt slightly annoyed and not angry. I guess that maybe I had mood swings that were at the root of this anger and the medication is taking care of it.How can I stop hitting things when angry as a coping strategy? For some reason, when I get angry, it just feels likes it's trapped inside of me and that the only thing I can do is release it. It's become an issue that happens at least once or so a day now. For some reason, in public I can contain my anger but when I'm at home I struggle to.

Let me give you an example of when this happened. I was once watching the news with my dad when he was watching something about transgender people in sports. I asked, ""what's the biggest issue with transgender people playing?"". After that, he said something along the lines of, ""you can't just ask questions without thinking first."" I was infuriated over his comment and a couple seconds later ended up slamming my hand down on the table.

Recently, maybe the last two years, it's gotten worse and harder to manage.

Trigger 1: Work - my boss has anger issues and very frequently get yelled at, even if its not my fault. A couple months ago, I accused him of verbal abuse. I'm very dedicated to my job and have worked for my boss since I was 17yrs old. I feel like quitting but being there for so long, I kinda feel obligated to stay.

Trigger 2: Family, specifically my sister. We are the complete opposite of one another in every way. We got into a huge fight and have not talked in almost a month.

Let me start by saying I'm not a very angry person I'm actually pretty calm and relaxed but one experience 7 years ago has been pissing me off and makes me snap at people if I feel like I'm being disrespected.

Basically what happened was: I was sitting on the bus across from a guy and I was looking out the window to his right. He says ""hey!"" I ignore him ""hey!"" I look at him ""you good?!"" I say yeah why? He points at the window ""why are you looking over there?!"" I stay silent aggressively he yells ""you good, you good?!"" I don't say anything and look away.

I'm still completely dumbfounded and pissed by the whole experience 7 years later. I wasn't looking at the guy at all! 

I think all of the anger was because I didn't stand up for myself I let it slide like a chicken instead of tossing the guy a hook. I told myself that day I'd never let anyone do that to me again. This has left me being very hostile to harmless jokes and has lead to a few fist fights where before I'd just shrug it off.

As i said I rarely get physical towards other people but i often destroy a mouse of keyboard or whatever I'm using at the moment by smashing it. I have replacement costs almost every month at I don' like the fact that I have such a short fuse. Music definitely helps to calm me down/keep me calm but that isn't a valid solution I think. Should I go see an anger management therapist?,181

946,Anger_947,hemicsa,Anger,"Quick snap and then I feel horrible what to do I am a female in my early twenties and only just started to realise I have horrible anger issues . 

I will be completely honest here, after ninth grade I completely lost the zest for life and I am constantly critical and angry at myself and others since then. I am close to finishing my college degree, but I feel very lost in life. It is to be noted I come from a family of angry members, my father has a big ego and if it is hurt a bit will proceed to anger outbursts , my mother is very OCD about many things and will scream on me for that and my brother who is my younger , has no respect for me , because he is doing way better academically and even financially, despite being 20ish.

I feel like I have been suffering from being lazy and unambitious ever since ninth grade , and now that it has been eight years of being on autopilot, i feel helpless and dont know how to come through . And this is resulting in me quickly snapping at people, especially those that are close to me . I almost feel like I have to emotionally detach myself from them and pretend they are strangers to be not angry at them. I feel horrible.

What do I do",247

948,Anger_949,ProfessionalFact4817,Anger,"Self-sabotage I have anger issues, but only very specific triggers. Namely problems of self-confidence.

Whenever something makes me feel like I am failing, like an exam in college or a test at work, I beat myself up to an often extreme extent where I can't stand to stay awake for the day and just go to sleep. It also gives me anxiety leading up to anything I perceive as a ‚Äòtest' even if there's nothing formal about it. It could be as simple as my manager asking me to do a new task.

It also builds up a great frustration in me, because I know I am sabotaging myself, and so I have an anxious part of me that I have come to hate desperately for its weakness. Naturally this hate conjures anger, and it is the anger that spills out over littler things like video games and family arguments. Sadly I inflict it upon people around me almost as much as I inflict it upon myself. 

I limit this to my family, I have only ever lost it at my parents and my brother, something in me thankfully won't let me cross over into shouting at friends through to strangers (I suppose at home I feel I am ‚Äòsafe' to vent and otherwise act out), but it is not pretty within my family and I am ashamed of it.

Some part of me is a prideful arrogant child that wants to pound the ground and preform tantrums to get its way, and eventually cries when that doesn't work (I have had a handful of emotional breakdowns at this point, about once every year, once in work where I barely made it to the bathroom to get some privacy). It's like being in an abusive relationship with myself.

Are other people familiar with this kind of self-targeting rage? I sense that many people view anger as primarily being driven by some form of surface indignation or need for aggression, but this feels genuinely soul-rending at times.",373

1. Express yourself
2. Take care of yourself
3. Build up your tolerance for frustration
4. Keep a positive outlook

1, 2, and 4 make perfect sense to me. I have a good idea how to work on those. But #3 is the hardest. I think the whole point is, the more you keep your cool, the easier it is to keep your cool. But that's not been my trend.

It's like I expect I'm going to lose my cool eventually. It's just a matter of time before I say a bunch of shit I don't mean and end up hurting people I love again.

There's got to be something just before I lose it that I'm missing. Some sort of red flag. And I've got to no only see it, but *know what to do with it.*

Sure, come over and test that theory.The only thing I love right now is thinking of my stalker being dead. I needed a place to put this, and most places are very against wishing death. I had a sort of a psychological breakthrough yesterday, for no clear reason but because of my venting. That yes, indeed the only thing I want is for my stalker to die. 

And for the most part it's just me daydreaming about being at their funeral, taking ironic peace sign and duck face selfies. But today, no matter what I think about my chest feels lighter happy, and it just gets happier the more I think of her dying. The worst scenario I tried out was peeling off the skin of their face and making her eat it. Yup, glee.

It's a twisted sort of caged feeling, definitely not the free healthy glee feeling. But for the time being I've stopped daydreaming about killing them in a rage, I just daydream about them dead.

I looked it up and people wish other people dead *all* the time. And I feel so at peace, and I don't want to go to Jail. So I won't kill her. But I'll be really fucking excited if she dies from covid. 

And the triggers that used to make me enraged. I just look back at them and say ""yes, you're a stalker/rapist/narcissist, that's why I love seeing you dead."" And smile. holy shit it's a creepily glowing smile, but I can't stop. But i think it means I truly don't care if they live or die.""

984,Anger_985,BrotherhoodOfWaves,Anger,"Is it extremely hard for anyone else to step back from their anger and just try to forget about it? I can hold constant, always active anger for probably weeks if I wanted to or it was bad enough. I can also admit a mistake I made even if it's embarrassing. But taking a step back and trying to calm down is extremely hard for me. I don't know whyDoes anyone else stay angry for a really long time? I can easily be very angry for weeks, and it doesn't seem to calm down at all unless I feel the situation is solved or I somehow got revenge on the person. I know this isn't healthy but my parents probably won't care to do anything about my anger issues. I'm angry now and I'm afraid my Christmas will be not as fun or relaxing because of it

Note I don't mean grudges, I mean actively angryChronic and extreme anger I cannot get this out. It feels like I want to break literally everything in sight and punch anyone who even looks at me. I don't know how to get it out (part of me doesn't want to let it go for some reason, maybe because it'd be submitting to people who want that). I really am not sure what to do at this point. Sometimes I'll just burst out in anger too, but it's not my house and I can't do anything because everyone gets mad at me. I know going into a rage is bad but it feels much better for me",297
985,Anger_986,xrobyn,Anger,"Tips for intercepting quick to rage 25F, anger just boils over so quickly and I let loose quite suddenly. A lot of the time I'll end up punching myself in the head/smacking myself in the face which does tend to calm me down a bit after I feel a bit of pain. That's only when I get full on hulk rage though.

I spit a lot of verbal vomit and afterwards I can't recall all of it since I get into such a fit if rage.

Work is a major subconscious stressor for me, I think a lot of my anger comes from an imbalance of work/home life, but unfortunately there's not an awful lot I can do about it, as I keep getting served impossible deadlines after repeatedly expressing that they need to stop assigning me loads of shit.

Unfortunately the people closest in my life also get served this stress by proxy by me flying off the handle.

Are there anyways I can try and suppress the demon/intercept it before it comes out to play? The root of the problem is not going away anytime soon as I need to keep job security in current pandemic &amp; Brexit climate.",219

987,Anger_988,yungjef_,Anger,"I can't control my anger at the smallest things many small things bother me, but it's normally associated with people being in my way. If I'm trying to cook and someone comes in the kitchen, instantly infuriated. If I'm deep into an article/video and my mom comes in my room, i can feel myself getting angry. Today people were in my house and I was just so angry about it the whole time. Because they are moving all around the house idk I feel like I can't do what I want to do like cook or just watch tv, idk why I feel so restricted when people are in my house, but i just do. So I went on a drive to release anger (as I commonly do) and hit a curb really hard and fucked up tire a bit. Now I am more angry. 
I've seen this happen time and time again, where my anger pushes me to do stupid shit that goes wrong and I get more angry. I just don't know what to do about it at this point. My dad and sister both get really angry all the time too, so I think it's genetic but I'd really like to fix this.

I'd also like to note that I really only show my anger and blow up when I'm around people I am comfortable with (my family, and a couple close friends) because everyone's reaction always makes me feel psychotic. Weirdly enough tho when I blow up with my friends I feel a bit better and they take it well and we move on quickly, but with my family it always makes me feel worse as they just explode right back. 

What should I do to solve this?",330
988,Anger_989,West_Alternative_420,Anger,"How far can anger management possibly go ? People say that your mood shouldnt depend on other peoples actions. Is this even possible ? To what extent ?

When it comes to strangers, I totally agree. I dont get mad (or at least never express anger) toward strangers even when they make mistakes (e.g. they give you the wrong orders etc..)

But when it comes to very close people in your personal circle like your parents or your spouse, can you truely be mentally divorced from their actions ? Does that mean you've reached a point where you no longer care ?

For example suppose your spouse lied to you, isnt it normal and even expected to get angry at them when you find the truth ? and that would mean you care about their honesty. Had you not even got bothered, does that mean you have excellent anger management skills or would that mean you gave up on trusting what your spouse says and you no longer care ?

To what extent does anger management go. Is it possible to ever reach a point where actions of close people in your personal circle no longer affects you ? Is that a good thing ? Or does that mean you've lost hope in trying ?",231

I went out of my way to clean the whole downstairs and spend over an hour cleaning. The very next day my room-mate starts complaining about how the trash is full and then comes upstairs and says with the biggest attitude you couldn't help me take out the trash? Like, dude. Do you actually need help taking out the trash? Trash is a one man job. If you're gunna take the trash out because it's full don't fucking complain about it. Anyway this guy gives an attitude to everyone and I've been so nice to him my whole time here but for some reason that just rubbed me the wrong way and I was fed up with his attitude so I started screaming at him and basically told him he needs to stop complaining and shut fuck up for once and he still wouldn't shut the fuck up. I wanted to beat the living shit out of him but I'm trying to learn how to control my feelings. Plus, I've already got enough legal problems. Oh, not to mention I lent him 50 bucks too to help him pay his car insurance and he is the worst driver. Multiple hit and runs plus DUI's and he's about to lose his license thank God.

992,Anger_993,Vitamina_Del,Anger,"Just figured my anger stems from being unable to emotionally connect with others. It's like I'm starving of affection. Just a very random post. I need to unload some thoughts. Hope someone finds it interesting to read it or comment and see who can relate... maybe give a few good tips. 

I hate watching my sibling continue a healthy loving relationship with the partner. I hate how my sibling has friends and a life.. while I, on the other hand, have already gone through 7 different people this year alone, have sex with a bunch of people and still can't get them to stay with me or attached. No matter how interested they are in the beginning, they end up leaving and it is annoying. I need that connection.. to feed me. 

I may sound like a bitch, but I am nothing but an empty sack of flesh and bones... I only feel for myself and sad for myself.. I don't care about anyone. I expect everyone to chase me and having a big ego while trying to have a relationship is like an armless man trying to do pull ups.... doesn't work.

I have an insane workout routine that keeps me mentally sane. When I hit that punching bag, is equally the same as taking a big shit... Soo emptying and satisfying. In fact, anger isn't always supposed to be adrenaline like or warm. I feel it almost all the time.. it's like I dissociate and forget to breathe and forget about my surroundings; exactly how I've been feeling since my 15th birthday. 

I've already got a few gray hairs in my head from all the rage I contain at such a young age, and I am just going to end this post by saying that I see no hope for myself.. and only destiny itself will determine how I'll end up. Definitely not a good ending.",363

Poor young people, being influenced by cheap appearance and bad stupid attitudes. 

I ripped off the toilet paper holder and smashed it into the ground, I feel like an animal. No physical activity can control me, I just wanna destroy everything as my father destroyed my childhood.

996,Anger_997,halfcanadian_,Anger,"Concerned about my anger, resentment and disgust for others after abusive relationship About a year ago, I left an abusive relationship where that person repeatedly would threaten suicide, self-harm in front of me, gaslight me, criticize almost everything about my life, and would vent to me for hours and hours. She would get angry at me for when I wanted to go to sleep before she would, so I often had to sleep until 4am (had to wake up at 6am for work) or she would scream at me and threaten to kill herself. 

I've noticed since then that I can't handle other people venting me without becoming enraged. I begin to feel extreme disgust for the people around me who do that because it reminds me of her. I tend to hate other people in general, and I've been told by my therapist that that is a way to push people away to avoid getting hurt like I once did.

I get the hypocrisy that I'm venting right now. I just want to know if anyone here has experienced something like this? It's to the point where I don't want to go outside because I see most people as awful (even though I know that's not true), and I'm also concerned that I might lash out someone since the anger has gotten worse. I understand this is irrational, and I don't want to feel like this.",269
997,Anger_998,Coach_Blackk,Anger,"I lost my shit today and nearly hit my mum Before some of you jump to conclusions, I love my mum with all my heart. I would never in a million years lay a finger on her and would probably go insane if something happened to her 

Earlier today I was watching Netflix, having a good time and some loud banging started happening upstairs. 

Usually I just let it be as my house is built like paper but for some reason I just lost my shit. My hands started tensing up and I just threw me headphones against my wall, ran out of my room shouting this and that and the top of my voice 

My mum came in and I just instinctively told her to fuck off (I would NEVER normally swear around my mum)

She took my headphones as like a punishment for throwing them on the floor and I ran after her, basically ripping them out of her hand and in doing so... they snapped.

This is where it got bad. When they broke I really lost my shit. My voice hurts from shouting so loud and I started just breaking everything I could see. I punched doors and punched my wardrobe so hard one of the doors just fell off.

I smashed a glass over my bed frame and ripped the light bulb from its socket

I was so angry that I didn't know who I was and I couldn't control it. This sort of stuff happens occasionally and I always seem to forget what happens after I've calmed down. My mum says it was like I was possessed and she said my eyes were different (not sure how true that is but)

Both my knuckles are swollen and now that I'm calm again, damn they hurt. 

Anyways. I was wondering if this is normal like if this stuff just ‚Äòhappens' sometimes?  or if it's something else.

Like I said, I really do lose control and I've thought about killing myself before when I'm in this state.

Okay have a good day guys :)",383

My (now) ex and I just called stuff off. Among a myriad of other things said that she was frightened of me at times when I would yell. I admit, at the beginning of our relationship I had a really short fuse. I did yell a lot and I would get animated. After a year of progress (progress that she recognized albeit she still said it was a huge red flag) it still felt terrible to hear that.

I really worked hard this past year to not yell, to try to breathe, to remain calm and I think I did a pretty good job, at least, that's what I've been telling myself. Instead of bottling up my emotions and exploding I shared what I felt in the moment. It feels like my progress didn't matter in the end. I'm really questioning myself at the moment.
