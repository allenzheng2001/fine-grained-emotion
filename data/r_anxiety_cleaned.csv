0,Anxiety_1,houseofsparrows,Anxiety,"I asked my friend a question and it became a much bigger deal that it was suppose to be. Not feeling okay at all and very anxious. I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh. 

We were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, ""oh hes not that,"" and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.",382
1,Anxiety_2,Affectionate_Hat494,Anxiety,"My aunt kept making my anxiety worse I consider myself relatively high functioning. I can talk to people just fine, but I need a lot of alone time to recharge. I went on a trip to Mexico to visit relatives. Some of my aunts and uncles from the US also came. I speak and understand Spanish really well, but combined with my anxiety and the language barrier, I won't talk very much

One time, we went to someone's house for New Years Eve. We had been there for five hours already, and I got kind of bored of listening to people talk. It's not that they're boring, but for me, listening to people talk in a language that's not my native language is difficult after several hours. I guess I was turning my head a lot, trying to find an interesting conversation, when my aunt asked me ""does it embarrass you to look at people?"" With a smile on her face

A couple of days later, we went to a party with mariachi. When we got there, my aunt said ""smile, look confident. Didn't your mother ever teach you that?"" With a smile on her face. An hour later, some people we knew arrived. After greeting them, we walked back to our table. I was ahead of my aunt, and I looked down for a split second. She said ""(my name), don't look down"". 

Another time, we went to someone's house for dinner. The hostess asked me if I liked the town. I said yes. I wanted to elaborate, but I had food in my mouth. The subject had already changed when my aunt started looking at me in my peripheral vision. She then whispered ""come on"".",345

The air is clean, it's not too cold or hot outside and while I still have anxiety rumbling beneath the surface, relief remains. 

As I breathe in the Autumn air, my heart slows down, not being able to pinpoint the sound since I am deaf, but I used to assume that it was upcoming traffic. There's a new part of me emerging that I never knew was inside. The part that hopes that it's the wind blowing, trees rustling, or something more beautiful because not everything has to be assumed. 
‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®

We are too comfortable with our minds sometimes because we assume that because something has happened once ( or maybe a few times ) is how it will end every time. That very protective strategy becomes this energy to isolate ourselves and avoid new opportunities. 

I know the ‚Äòcoulds' are terrifying.

"" I could be hurt ""

5,Anxiety_6,Foreign-Wind-8793,Anxiety,panicking alot lately Hi I'm new to reddit but I've been having some really bad fears of being schizophrenic. I've been just haven't been right since. I've been to a psychiatrist and she says I show no signs of it and I have no family history of it. But I've been getting panick attacks about it. I've had some bizzare thoughts in my head.  Like I was in Wendy parking lot getting my food I was fumbling with my drink I was anxiety ridden at the time and then I looked at my drink and thought what if that straw turned into a snake. That freaked me out then I thought I was going to start seeing that. Then that kinda passed and then my mind was wondering then I was like what if my fingers turned into snakes. I'm like what is going on in my mind now I'm worried looking at my hands thinking I'm gonna hallucinate it. I'm on new meds for anxiety and depression that I'm still on my old meds so I can ween off them. I'm taking Celexa and Cymbalta. I'm just utterly scared that this is happening to me,222

I had my first practice per se today and got to meet my coach and fellow teammates. I liked them and my coach. My first real practice is this coming Monday, and my first game is Friday. You might be thinking, ""he's anxious about getting hurt"" but no. I am anxious of letting the team down. These guys are really down to earth guys, respecting each teammate as a brother. They even showed me some substantial love today. But the team we go up against is best in state. I am worried I will perform poorly and let the team down. I don't want to be the player that saves the game, and is the talk of the school, I just want to show these guys I love football as much as them.",168
9,Anxiety_10,Theguyrandom1,Anxiety,"Is it weird to talk to a girl after 2 years of not talking to her? Hi I have social anxiety and I was wondering, there's this girl that occasionally walks past me in the hallway and we were classmates for one year in a class and I have tried to initiate contact with her. She actually said she liked me 2 years prior (we have 1.5 years of online school), but I ghosted her which was very dumb and entirely my fault. I have miserably failed because of my social anxiety around her. My heart races and my mind goes blank with hesitation every time I'm around her. I haven't really talked to her for 2 years, so I am thinking that I would come off as a creep if I were to talk to her. And she typically walks at a 4mph rate, with arms crossed, looking down, so I don't really know if randomly saying hello would come off as weird or not, or if she doesn't even see me. She is sorta anti-social, yet dresses very nicely with makeup and jewelry. I was just wondering if randomly saying hi to her after 2 years would be creepy? And, I would also really appreciate some tips.",235

I don't think I will be able to sleep at all until the job is finished. It's at a datacenter so it makes me feel trapped because of the high security and the cold. Which is just going to contribute to the anxiety. I want to go because it sounds interesting but at the same time, I'm afraid it's gonna be too much for me to handle.

That someone was following me, trying to kidnap me, kill me, etc. I'd even have nightmares of it. When I was younger I didn't really draw any attention to it and would just brush it off because I didn't know what it meant and when I would feel anxious I would just go to sleep and eventually my anxiety would go away. Now that I'm older I still feel like this sometimes and I feel like it's preventing me from doing certain things or preventing me from properly growing up.

15,Anxiety_16,ValuableVegetable7,Anxiety,"Road test anxiety I have taken my road test to get my driver's license twice and I have had an anxiety attack both times (shaking, feeling dizzy/nauseous). I felt so disassociated and forgot  everything I needed to do. On the most recent one, the examiner was so nice and had me pull over to the side of the road because she thought I looked too nervous, but I still messed up most of the test. I agreed with my therapist that I'm going to take some time to work through my driving anxiety before I take another test, but I'm so embarrassed to tell my family/friends that I failed again. Whenever I try to be honest with someone about why I failed, they always respond with ""what are you going to do later in life?"" or ""you're going to have to overcome that"". It gets tiring.

I want to travel, but simply driving and going into Walmart can send me into a derealization episode. I have panic attacks where everything looks like I'm playing a VR game and I begin vomiting and hearing people talk is scary. My anxiety then makes me have an insane amount of guilt for those around me. I need help! But I have a part time job, making 16.50 an hour so I can't really afford expensive health insurance.

so yeah obviously this is all wonderful news and I'm super happy because I've been manifesting this for a while, but because I have anxiety I'm like, ""so when is it all messing up?"" Because that's what happens with me. When I get good things I become immediately skeptical.

Unless they are in the movies and are like R2D2 or C3PO,  I have a real existential dread of robots and AI.  Being told to get the hell over it and adapt just makes me get angry that I wasn't born in the 50s or 60s.  I honestly hate technology and I feel inferior over it, I feel like it just makes everyone lazier and less likely to think; and I don't want to see robots taking jobs.   I know automation and machines have always replaced workers, but there was always new stuff to do.  I have this great fear of the world just turning out like Wall-e, where everyone just sits around, while robots do all the work.  This is an actual fear of mine, and my brain is constantly trying to find ways to show that yes, people are getting lazier, yes people are getting dumber.  Or you actually like going to school in person, using paper money, shopping in physical stores, hobbies where you work with your hands?  No one wants that anymore, in the future everything will be all computers and technology.   I just feel like tech is just so damn impersonal, and I feel like I am the only one feeling this way that is my age.  Sometimes I honestly wonder if I am a bad person or a narcissist for thinking that we shouldn't want to be too reliant on technology, and it is good to want to contribute to society and use our brains and muscles.   I honestly don't know what is wrong with me.",319

But at this point I don't even care about the bigger picture Very long story cut short I planned a trip to see my family for a couple of weeks and I knew that my sleep schedule would be an issue because my anxiety prevents me from sleeping for days at times 

I've tried sleeping pills but I don't know what it truly is. Sometimes pills don't work. 

Anyways I wasted about $700 on plane tickets and other things for travel. Such a waste and time and only spent two days here.

The job itself isn't bad, i find myself liking talking to customers and my co workers are really nice, but i feel really underprepared in terms of training, obviously since it's my second day, but they already had me on the bar and in the drive through and i feel as though if this is how quickly they expect me to be able to work efficiently with the rest of the team then i am fked . I haven't really been able to eat since i started and i barely sleep anymore because i am so anxious and constantly dreading the next shift, and the rest of the week because i only have two days off.

But, I dont think i'm able to take care of myself properly while i'm so anxious. I am crying at night when i get home and in the morning before shifts and i'm not even able to do anything else but stress out until I go in.

I don't know what steps to take to help myself right now and I was wondering if the job is really worth all the stress and anxiety. i try many coping techniques like breathing and the 333, and journaling and talking it out or just crying to expel whatever i need to, but it's like a never ending cycle help.",360

22,Anxiety_23,dogtriumph,Anxiety,"I want what Ambien does with my anxiety but 24/7, not only when I'm about to sleep. What other medication does that? I've done Klonopin and Xanan in the past and because it was incredibly addictive and I knew that the long-term damage in the brain would be irreversible I decided to quit.\*\*

Klonopin gives me a mellow and sweet feeling, but in the next day I feel super depressed. And Xanax never did anything to me besides brutally kill my appetite.

Ambien on the other hand... ignoring the part where we get crazy and do stuff that we will regret later, like texting an old crush and asking him on a date (yeah, I had the date... today, btw! oh well, it was fast)... so, what I was saying is that the good part of Ambien is that you feel some kind of freedom and a really peaceful state of mind.

LSD gave me the closest to what I should feel to be the happiest... but only during the trip. But then there's a problem: you can never know what your next trip will be like. And from paradise I went to pure nightmare (ER and shit). So I don't feel like trying it again even microdosing - same goes for shrooms. And weed... yeah, it's pleasurable and shit, but I don't know how it would be if I use it in long term.

I'm thinking more of a controlled substance for now, aimed for anxiety and is similar to what Ambien does. What do we have? I want to have my mind exactly like it is right now while I'm on Ambien: I feel that I can focus, study and the same time being super original e capable of relax whenever I can.

I texted my girlfriend telling telling her what was going on and she got worried and called. When she called, I was short and probably sounded like a jerk. I was like this for 3) reasons:

1.) When I get really anxious or depressed, I have trouble speaking. Like the words just won't come out.
2) When she called I was about to feed my dog, and it was taking all of my willpower and focus to get a grip long enough to do that to the point I couldn't have my attention elsewhere.
3) I was barely holding my shit together, and didn't want to break down over the phone?

It ended up working and she became really friendly! Ended up brushing up against me everywhere, licked my hand (no open wound), and other things like that. At some point, i think she was trying to lick me again but i felt her tooth on my leg. No bite mark, but what I think might be a pimple on my leg, idfk lmao, and thus no blood (however i keep noticing stories of people who get rabies from seemingly invisible bite marks, but those are from bats, not cats). 

At first, I was fine... and then I looked up ""rabies"" on Google, and here I am 8 hours later still researching it. I remember looking up symptoms of rabies while the cat was just chilling there lol. Anyway, I read a bunch of shit. The cat looked friendly, like any normal outdoor cat. It was a little shy around new people but got accustomed to you if you gave it the chance to.

however, after the year online, we went back in person and the desks are spread apart. the thing is, in two of my classes, the desks aren't spread apart. it's not a covid concern when i sit close to people, something about sitting so close to others just makes me feel...claustrophobic? i don't know if that's the word, since i never had this issue before. i was diagnosed with severe anxiety a couple years ago, but sitting close to people was never a big trigger. 

i get super tense and i feel so overstimulated when i sit still in these classes. my hands sweat, i feel tense yet like jelly, my throat tightens up like there's a lump inside, and my stomach starts making weird noises (which is AWFUL because i'm literally sitting shoulder to shoulder between two people). by the end of class, i have to take extremely deep breaths because it feels like i'm choking. 

i don't know what to do, because i have these two classes everyday, and everyday i experience this awful feeling.",250

Today I was prescribed sertraline, and I even went to pick it up and it's in my medicine cabinet now.

I'm under a tremendous amount of pressure to get very high grades (straight A's). I've completed 2 exams, and have 5 left to go, 3 of which I'll be sitting tomorrow, the next day, and the day after that...

I'm shocked at how this stress has effected me physically. I've always been fairly neurotic, but the anxiety I tend to feel is transient, and is rarely severe enough to manifest in anything physically significant, beyond a raised pulse and slight breathlessness.

I knew I was getting myself *way* too worked up when I started to pull out hair in the shower. I have very thick hair, so a lot of it was coming out. I've had severe brain fog, which hasn't been the least bit helpful during a time when I have to be the most alert and ‚Äò*with it*'. I've had no appetite, and now my trousers are all loose, with one  pair literally falling down when I walk. The most bizarre symptom I've had is this weird jaw tension - my jaw is very clicky, and it feels incredibly tense and stiff. As a hypochondriac, I was convinced this was a heart attack, but I was reassured that it's probably just anxiety. I've had weird gastrointestinal symptoms, where I feel nauseous, and have this pit in my stomach all of the time, which could be caused by the lack of eating, but it persists even when I have eaten. 

And then of course feelings of impending doom, etc etc.

Nothing was ever ""easy"" for me and still is not. Sometimes I feel like in order to do anything I have to use all of my energy, whereas other people can do it and use almost no energy.

I have tried many things to help my anxiety, but still it persists. I have been to counseling, which helped slightly, I am on anxiety medicine too since counseling did not help enough. Even with anxiety medicine, I still struggle with anxiety and because of it, depression. My anxiety medicine seems to have bad side effects, like no sex drive, super irregular periods, tiredness, night sweats. I would say it slightly helps but I also wonder sometimes if it is just a placebo affect in my mind.

 I struggle to work, be social or anything ""normal"" people do. The longest I have had a job was 7 months straight before I quit and changed jobs. I am a hard worker when my anxiety doesn't get the best of me and I have excelled in any job I have done. I've even excelled in school and just got my Associates degree. Now I am incredibly anxious because I need to get a job again now that I completed school but all I can think of is how anxious it makes me.

55,Anxiety_56,kolatie,Anxiety,"Dealing with other people's bad moods/raging For people who are very sensitive to other people's moods, do you have any tips or tricks on how to deal with it?

This in specific for me is my SO's raging during his gaming. It's a daily occurrence of cursing and raging at his game and it stresses me out beyond belief. More than it should for what it is, I think. 

Instinctively I feel a strong urge to flee, to get away from the house, or his vicinity or even ending the relationship altogether because I feel I've reached my tolerance limit. 

I'd think that's how I usually get around people who are generally very emotional in a negative way - I want to flee from them and get them out of my life completely. Even when they're generally nice and good to me, this instance of being negative affects me to the point where I cannot see anything but it and not feel anything for them but... aversion? 

Maybe it's possible to go through life and avoid such people altogether, but I'm sure there are situations where you somehow just have to deal with it, being in a relationship at times or maybe in a workplace environment or with family members. 

I've asked him to stop many times, it's gotten better, a bit, but I don't think he'll ever stop, and I cannot control him or other people, so I'd like to find a way to control it within myself. To not take it as personal and devastatingly as I do. The anxiousness it gives me overpowers anything and everything. My thoughts, my emotions, my actions in ways. 

So, does anyone have tips for me to try?",332

I didn't want to look weak, so I laughed out loud and yelled back ""you mad!"" then he snapped back with ""nobody needs to know y'all are having sex!"" and then kept goin on and on with his aggressive shouting. finally I go ""alright, alright"" and he walks away talking under his breath.

For me, there is no particular thing I get anxious about, no particular situation. I'm fine with phone calls, public speaking, all the classics. 

I get anxious when I have to do tasks that may reflect on my ability, intelligence, or self-worth. I also get anxious when I have to do things to achieve something that I care about. The sad thing is that I'm a huge procrastinator due to that. Avoidance and procrastination are how I cope. The issue is that it branched out so much it affects almost every activity. Most of the time though there is no other thing I should be doing. It's just me trying to do something, becoming more and more anxious and dropping it.

If I think I wanna work out, I'm anxious because I think I should be doing work. If I wanna work, I'm anxious because I think I should work on personal projects. If I wanna work on personal projects, I'm anxious because I think I should work out. It never ends. 

I don't get panic attacks or a faster heart rate or anything, I just get a deep sense of dread and tunnel vision if that makes sense, it's just an ""oh shit"" feeling that I can't shake.

But sometimes it's for no reason. Sometimes it just happened because I get up fast out of bed and the cold shocks me. It starts off with me feeling extremely cold like I'm freezing. I then seize up and start shaking uncontrollably and very aggressively. My teeth clench and I can barely talk. I would say it almost looks like I'm having a seizure but I'm completely conscious and aware the whole time. It's more body than mind but it's really intense and it usually last about 5-20 minutes depending on how fast I can get all the covers on me and eventually warm up. 

Does anyone else experience this? Is this just a panic attack or should I see a doctor?",169

I started my current position in august but have called out/left early several times due to the fact that my anxiety makes me physically ill. (Heart rate above 150 and uncontrollable throwing up) making it impossible for me to be in a public environment. This past Thursday I received a very unexpected call that my grandmother who I was very close to was on life support and it was critical that we needed to go see her that day. Friday I asked to stay off with her again due to the fact she was going to be removed from life support and was not expected to make it. Thinking about going in tomorrow is making me sick. Her funeral will not be until Thursday and I know I cannot be in the environment for the next three days while I am grieving. But I feel as if I have already taken too much time and I need my job to pay my bills. Not to mention I am getting married in May and require two weeks off for travel.

78,Anxiety_79,Better_Ad_9242,Anxiety,"Managing anxiety without it affecting me to the point where it gets crippling Hi! New poster so I apologize for any mistakes! 

I've been dealing with anxiety and panic attacks since I was in middle school, and I know that they are caused by abandonment issues, as well as some insecurities. I know exactly what my triggers are, why they happen and what specific fear is causing them....so for the most part I have been able to manage it without medication or therapy. Unfortunately, things began to peak two years ago during the beginning of covid and my stress and anxiety ended up actually causing shingles. After this, and getting covid, a few other random symptoms began to occur during major anxiety episodes. These still happen to this day, when it gets bad enough, but doctors have assured me these symptoms are my ""post covid norm now"". A lot happened in that time to cause it, so it wasn't one specific trigger like it used to be. Ever since, I have had a much more difficult time controlling the spiraling that occurs once the thoughts creep in. It is now affecting my personal relationships as well. 

My question is, how are you able to manage the physical and emotional symptoms of anxiety when a major episode does occur? Is medication and therapy really the best and only solution?",257

- Trying to go to sleep but your eyes won't unfocus behind your eyelids and they get super tense

- Legs suddenly become 40% jello

- Brain homepage is just a 404 error

- Someone left the adrenaline faucet running and I can't turn it off

- Heart is pounding so hard I'm worried for my eardrums

- Heart *isn't* hammering out of my chest so it must have stopped suddenly and I'm dead now

- Someone emptied my brain's file cabinets onto the floor and lit them on fire

- Red warning light is on but it has no label

- Nausea, but not the throwing up kind? Do I need to sneeze?

- Spasms in muscles I didn't know I had

- Ear is rumbling because I've been clenching my jaw so hard and now I can't make it stop

- Chronic shortness of breath = uncontrollable yawning

- Everything is too loud but also I can't really hear

- Uh oh, someone slipped and pushed the Sudden Dread button, which is pretty inconvenient because I'm in a meeting

- Hot and shivering

- Entire face hurts

- Ears suddenly rebooted and the settings are all messed up, all I hear is intense bass and high pitched ringing for 10 seconds

So, i visited all kinds of doctors to exclude physical things. Except some stronger tension in neck and upper spine, everything looks well.

So i assume, the issue i have is anxiety.

My anxiety attacks last sometimes 5-7 minutes, sometimes around 15 minutes. 

They are not so strong i can fight them off without medications, probably because of the line of work iam in (talking to people, moving around town, i just cant avoid people and public at work).

For those outside England a quick simplified brief on our tax system.  If you work for an employer they normally work out how much tax etc you owe and it's deducted at source so what you get in your pay check is yours. But if you're self employed you have to fill in a tax return each year. You can fill in the return from the 6th April and it has to be done by 31st January the following year. So the tax return I've just submitted is for tax year 2020-2021.

I hate doing my tax return. My accounts are really simple, profits easy to calculate and very few expenses. But I'm so paranoid I'll do something wrong. There's so many different fields to fill in and I have no clue what half of them mean. I've always asked my sister to sit with me in the past when I do my returns but this year I did it all on my own.

To further complicate matters my accounts last year are screwed up because of coronavirus. My income was down ~75% but I was eligible for a government support scheme called the Self Employment Income Support Scheme. However I then had to declare all these figures on my tax returns which was even more boxes to tick.

I also had to claim my fifth grant which means working out my turnover for the last two years etc. and freaking out that I'll somehow claim the wrong amount or screw something up.

It took me two weeks of staring at the folder to build up the courage and then about half an hour ago I finally hit that sweet spot of the anxiety of not doing it outweighing the anxiety of doing it (the grant deadline is September). So here I am just after midnight waiting for the anxiety adrenaline rush to die down so I can actually get some sleep.

For example I get heart palpitations which is one of the most common physical symptoms but my main worry is the occasional breathing difficulty episode.

I'm unsure whether I have something wrong with my lungs like asthma or something else but most people I've talked to about it say it's my anxiety and I'm fine.

However sometimes it's so bad I'm literally on the verge of dropping to the floor or fainting which also happened today where I felt as though I couldn't breathe properly and it also didn't feel like an anxiety attack because I wasn't really anxious apart from the fact I felt like I was about to faint.

So I have had anxiety for a couple of years... I never really got panic attacks when I was first diagnosed, but within the last two years I started getting panic attacks whenever I smoke weed (I still smoke weed, but every time I get an anxiety attack I tell myself I am going to quit.. obviously this does not pull through). Anyways, within the last two months I now have been having anxiety attacks almost every day, without weed. 

I am a 22 year old female, and I am really not healthy at all... I am not overweight, but I don't eat healthy and I do not work out (my own fault, I have no self-control). 

I really worry about my heart because when I am having an attack, I literally feel like I am going to die of a heart attack or that my heart is going to explode or my veins are going to burst. My heart rate goes up to 160bpm when I am in the midst of an attack. My resting heart rate is high as shit. 

I am really hoping somebody can give me tips on dealing with this? I am not on medication, I have tried, I just cannot do it. It fucks my brain up.

The Prozac LITERALLY saved my life and I have never felt better before. I'm thankful I finally took the huge step into starting medication and happy with the results from it.

 My anxiety is basically non existent in my everyday life but the only thing that is still bothering me is this really weird and specific anxiety I get when I'm outdoors. I tend to get really freaked out by large open spaces, especially large streets, intersections, highways, city streets, or walking on a crosswalk.

I am 50 years old and a pretty easy going person and about a year ago I suddenly developed anxiety with panic disorder for no apparent reason. I have begun to wonder if it my Fitbit watch causing this. I started wearing this wearable device 24/7 six months prior to developing anxiety and a few days ago I wondered if it was the cause of my anxiety and panic so I stopped wearing it. It has only been a few days of not wearing the device but I am way less tense and have not had any issues yet. I know this is a little premature but I was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience with these watches?,139
164,Anxiety_165,SunnyDazed92,Anxiety,"Losing my mind I feel like I've just really done myself in at this point and I'm about to have a mental breakdown. I suffer from GAD, panic disorder, and PTSD. 

A few months ago I started feeling really anxious about my future. I work as an infant teacher and absolutely love it - unfortunately the child care field is just not the easiest place to work. I would live paycheck to paycheck if it wasn't for my boyfriend, I get no benefits, no 401K so I started to get really paranoid about what will happen in the future and just money money money. I started looking into RBT jobs doing ABA therapy home based. I got a part time position working with one client. The starting pay is $8 more than I make in child care and I felt like I just couldn't say no. 

So I work with infants from 7:00-2:30 and go to the other job from 4:30 - 6:30. Its only my second week of doing both jobs and I'm just fucking regretting everything. I'm so tired. I feel like I have no time to breathe. I feel like I'm a failure if I quit the RBT when I literally had to complete training, assessment, and exam. I feel like I won't be happy if I leave working with infants but at the same time my co workers just make the job unbearable most days. I feel like no one cares when we are literally taking care of the fucking future of our species. 

I hate having to pick between money. I want to quit the second job. I just feel like I can't do both but going in the direction of ABA means more money so I don't know what to do. I can't stop crying and Ive had two panic attacks today Im letting everyone down 

I just feel like a fucking joke and a child that can't make up their mind",365
165,Anxiety_166,Librero234,Anxiety,"How much do you share about your internal struggles? Me and my boyfriend are long distance (have met and spent time together though). It's been really, really freaking great so far. I've also recently started seeing a therapist for various issues. One of which is anxiety and mine is a lot related to relationships and just getting anxious that people just stick around until they find something better and then just throw me to the side. 

The recent week has been difficult, he has his own mental health issues and a busy life (much more outgoing then I am so his evenings are rarely just staying at home). Usually we check in on each other, often have video calls etc. Last week due to his schedule and his mental health we barely managed to check in with each other and we haven't had a video call for days now. 

The thing is, he is really trying, this isn't a ""my boyfriend is bad post"" wrong subreddit, the thing is that despite his efforts, despite him making me feel very safe most of the time, my anxiety just can't shut up that we have reached the point again where he drops me, where he finds out that hanging with his real life friends is so much more fun, that he gets annoyed by the messages I send him, etc. 

Now my question: seeing as none of this is his problem and he is doing his absolute best (especially considering his not so great mental health atm), do I share that I am feeling very insecure right now? And how much do I share? We are generally very open about our mental health struggles.

A week ago I visited this gynaecologist who had just come after visiting a ""patient"" in another ward, I don't remember all the details but she then came back in her office and we had our talk and then she asked me to lay on the little bed kind of thing to examine me- it was done within 5 seconds. Two three days after I developed a mouth ulcer and my stomach started aching a bit and also some thick kinda discharge from my V, I am around my period date so maybe discharge could be because of that?. I am now freaking out if it was because she examined me, I don't really remember if she wore gloves or not or washed her hands or not. The things I am experiencing might now be related to the examination but my anxiety is telling me otherwise. What is this patient of hers was not a pregnant lady but someone who had come for STIs/ Infections and she just touched me like that raw ( don't remember much). But I also find it stupid that she would not even take care of her own safety by not wearing gloves or washing hands, right before and after examining the other patient and me?

200,Anxiety_201,TcBeckman,Anxiety,"I'm always terrified (creeped out to a very high degree) at night, and it's been interfering with my sleep quite a lot lately. Any advice would be appreciated. I'm a 21M student currently working through a long-lived case of debilitating social anxiety. Little by little, I think my condition is improving, but there's one thing that just seems to be getting worse and worse. Nearly every night, after everyone around me is asleep, I'm just terrified of things that will never happen. 

I hate to look into reflections or even turn around out of fear that something is standing behind me. I have to make sure my blinds are air tight out of fear that I'll spot an eye peeping through a gap. I'll go thirsty because I'm afraid that on my way to get water, I'll see a doll somewhere it has no business being. Sometimes I run out of bed because I'm afraid my door will slam itself shut. Being in bed is pointless anyway because I need to open my eyes every few seconds.

Something that makes this so confusing to me is that I'm not scared that I'll be in danger in the slightest. The thought of turning around and seeing a menacing monster or knife-wielding killer doesn't phase me. I'm not afraid of what I think might happen to me, I'm afraid of what I might see. A creepy figure that's there one instant and gone the next, a mismatched smile when I look into the mirror, etc.

Dolls in particular unnerve me down to my core. I know damn well that I can punt a doll across the neighborhood, but they're still the focus of all of my nightmares. Anything else that's vaguely human gets to me too.

I've been dealing with this since I was a kid, but it's really starting to impact my life. On a good work night, I can manage 5-6 hours of sleep.",377

I also had a low grade fever at the time which my doctor also thought was caused by stress and anxiety. 
But now, a couple weeks later, I've had a low grade fever for a few days that fluctuates between 96.5-101.5 but is usually around 99.5.

208,Anxiety_209,Summer_91,Anxiety,"Surprise Parties Hello,

My name is Summer and last week I turned 25. All week last week my friends avoided discussing my birthday.  I texted my best friend about it being my birthday week and she just put a thumbs up. I wasn't expecting anything physical but more of my friends acknowledging it was my birthday week ( it's something we do in our friend group).

No one seemed to care so I started to think my friends were upset with me. I had so much anxiety.I felt forgotten and went on a 3 day rant with my husband the week of my birthday about everyone forgetting me and how I prioritize their birthdays and special events. My husband told me he was disgusted by my behavior and how I came off self centered and said ""maybe you shouldn't do nice things for people if you expect something in return."" He also said if my friends heard my rant they wouldn't want to be my friends anymore.

All a long, My friends planned a surprise party for me and it was beautiful. I immediately felt guilty for assuming everyone forgot about me. My husband didn't know about the party, but still told me how ""ugly"" my personality was when I was ranting, and that he strongly suggests I don't do anything nice for anyone in the future because he doesn't want me to act that way ever again.

Am I self centered for assuming everyone forgot about me? 

I think I'm genuine when I do something nice for someone, but does me getting upset about no one talking about my birthday mean I'm not genuine when I do nice things for them?

I quit without a 2 weeks notice yesterday (something I feel guilty for but my mental health is more important at this point) and was already browsing and applying to other jobs before quitting.

I don't want to reach out to my parents or explain why I quit because I don't want to 1. possibly be shamed and/or 2. be further infantilized by them (which would only make me feel worse).

Rationally I know that being alone all the time probably isn't a healthy idea for me mentally and that I'm probably not correct about all of them secretly hating me, but being alone without the constant feeling of being an unlikeable mess is so much easier.

Thinking about it, I reckon a lot of my anxiety around friendship dynamics is rooted in me being bullied pretty hard in my ""friendship groups"" as a young child. I just genuinely find friendships more terrifying to navigate than any other kind of relationship. I'd say I even find them scarier than romantic relationships in ways, at least when you're dating you're getting to know one person, not an entire group.

That was like 2 weeks ago. I just sent a message on WhatsApp to that person and now their profile doesn't pop up after they read it.

I didn't give them my number and just added them randomly and sent a stupid meme and ""hey"", but I'm not sure if they knew it was me. This is for a different country, too, so they don't know my number in US.

After getting the vaccine I was fine for two days but on the third day I woke up in complete panic.

Most of the regular symptoms of a panic attack weren't present during this attack such as the fast heart rate, shallow breathing and feeling like I was dying but what WAS present was an inability to think straight and as a result talk correctly. 

It's been 4 months now and the symptoms have gotten ever so slightly better but my mental capability is still not to the level it was before the attack (I still can't think about things as clearly as before nor talk as confidently, math has become quite difficult and so has reading) and also my anxiety towards other things has increased greatly. 

I was wondering if anyone else was going through this and if you were able to find anything that helps?

It sometimes felt like my right side tonsil was bruised deeply within and this ""twang"" went from my tonsils to just below my collar bone. 

Anyway, I decided to look and see if sore throats are a side effect of propranolol and it was reported it was a rare but serious one. I called and left my psychiatrist a message but heard nothing back. I decided to just stop the medication altogether, just in case. I did smoke several cigarettes this day, but what happened next is something that hasn't happened previously to me from cigarettes so idk what's the deal with this.

I took a very long break from caffeine and got back into it sometime in the fall around October/November 2021. That's when I had an episode again with left arm tingling and facial tingling. 

Since then til today. My left arm has a numbing/dead arm feelingS literally from the shoulder down, it doesn't change. Anytime I wake up my left arm has a ""different"" feeling compared to my right which feels fine.

I have stopped caffeine but it's still going on, sometimes there's pain in my left hand, it used to be pretty bad and constant but it has subsided.

I have gone to my regular doctor who checked for heart attack, heart issues, ran EKG. Says I am fine which is great to hear, I have ruled out my heart even before that but at this point I'm confused... this has been going on now what, 6 months now? Can it be anxiety? I am pretty calm right now, I get married in a few weeks I just want to be healthy and normal mentally and physically and I don't even know where to start or what doctor's to go to, to find the root of this ""problem""

I absolutely love it's effectiveness for my panic attacks and daily anxiety and it works really well for me. On my last psychiatrist appointment, she suggested trying Klonopin instead because she said it is better for long term use. Since it's also a benzo i figured there's no harm in just trying it out for a month since my anxiety is pretty stable at this point. For the past four nights i've taken 0.5 of Klonopin just for my nightly insomnia due to racing thoughts. I usually take it before dinner and i've noticed that it definitely helps me feel calm and relaxed but i also have noticed i've been feeling more depressed, sad, and down for no reason at all. When i would take xanax, i would feel so happy, carefree, social, and like i was a normal person. But with this klonopin i feel like there's a heaviness in my chest and a black cloud over me and i don't really know why. i don't know if this could be due to other reasons (PMS, adderall) but nonetheless i've noticed a difference. I just wanted to know if anyone else has experienced this because if so i'm going to switch back to xanax, but if it's just me it might be something i need to change unrelated to the klonopin because it still helps my anxiety.",280

I could barely control my own body. I've never had that sort of thing while walking before. I've had a panic attack before so i knew the whole symptoms and what it felt like. It was the exact same symptoms except less intense than my first ever panic attack which I've had back in 2020. 

I haven't felt like myself ever since my panic attack. I've had so many symptoms ever since and a lot of the time it's pretty overwhelming especially when I've had to deal with this all on my own.

282,Anxiety_283,MilkRepresentative16,Anxiety,"Chest tensions when I'm with others Hello everyone,

I have an annoying problem. What happens is that when I'm with others, particularly in groups, my heart and/or chest is contracting. It starts okay, but then the tension becomes stronger and stronger the more I'm around people -- like if I have to be ready for a fight or something, even though the situation is perfectly fine. The only way to get back to normal is being by myself.

Those contractions make me stressed (mentally), which in turn has a strange effect on me: I feel super dumb, have a hard time finding my words, my thoughts don't make sense, etc. It's like my brain is working at 25% of its capabilities.

I've tried therapy, doing sports every day, changing my diet and meditation. They don't really help much with that. My problem is kind of hard to explain but let's say that if I could ""trust"" my body for not doing weird things like that and just being more stable, I would be more confident. At the moment what sucks is that I can't trust my own body to handle normal life situations, which hinders me from doing social activities.

Is there something I can do about this?",247

I struggle with seeing my anxiety as a personality trait, because of how much it impacts my life, so she told me that I should try characterizing my anxiety; giving it a name, a personality, or drawing it out. Just being able to visualize it. This should help me recognize when it is the anxiety talking and not me, and when I see this I can push it aside easier.

It really helps when I get in an anxiety hole and I just have to stop and think, ""this isn't me thinking, this is my anxiety."" I kind of visualize just scooping up my anxiety character and throwing them away. 

I find i also tend to be very scared of my anxiety, scared of what it does to my body and panic attacks and such, making it a character helps make it less scary. 

I've been in therapy / counseling for *years* and I'd never heard of this! I find it helps me because I'm a very visual person, its a lot easier to picture a character than a feeling.

While some of my fidgeting is probably not as noticeable (picking at threads of fabric, playing with anything on my desk, taking constant drinks of water, lip biting), some might be more publicly noticeable (constantly moving my foot position from crisscross, to crossing and re-crossing legs, cracking knuckles or jaw, picking at skin or scratching impulsively, moving constantly whether it be my hands or feet). This occurs for me whether I feel super anxious, a little anxious or not anxious at all in that moment. I also can't stop it no matter how hard I try. Occasionally I use therapy putty to give my hands something to do, but sometimes this draws attention from others when I take it out or if it makes a popping sound on accident.

It runs in his family and he has siblings who are taking medication for anxiety. However, he does not feel like a medical solution is the right fit for him.

I'm not an anxious person. I just go full steam ahead and do things, not worry, get over things quickly and rarely feel trepidation about impending tasks, or  worry about small things. However these are things that constantly consume my partner's thoughts. The stress and the worry definitely puts him in a negative headspace a lot of the time. He is also anxious about things getting done properly and is particular about doing things a specific way, and doesn't necessarily want other people to do it a different way, and gets stressed and worried if its not done in his way.

These are all little things that he feels every day, as part of every decision, and throughout his life. I have a lot of trouble relating and empathizing in many situations, and I often take the approach of saying things like ""stop worrying about it"", ""its not a big deal let it go"" ""why are you so particular?"" etc but I want to work on myself on not letting his way of processing get to me and I want to accept him for who he is. 

What are ways I can validate him and his journey, support him and not make him feel smaller or lesser for feelings and thoughts that are out of his control?

I live with pretty severe anxiety and so I honestly feel like I'm not gunna have any friends ever again. I try to fit in with people but I constantly hold myself back because I'm so anxious of letting people in or letting people see the real me. 

I can't sleep at night wondering if I'm going to be this lonely for the rest of my life. I'm in a different country, only know my husband and the people around him. Unless I get to grips with anxiety I fear that I'm going to live a pretty lonely life. 

Any advice on how to kick anxieties ass and throw myself out there? I don't toot my own horn but I'm the type of person everyone needs as a friend, fiercely loyal and I'm fun to be around. I just wish I could show the world that.

Anxiety and I don't have a good relationship and it's always hindering me with awful physical symptoms. My exam ended last month and I started having heart palpitations (skipped beats)... I thought it was fine until the acknowledgement of this new side effect. 

I did tests for my palpitations about 7 years ago (the palpitations lasted one year before i went to my cardio). The cardio told me that ordinary people dont even feel it. Ironically, after I heard that, the palpitations went away. Since then, the palpitations could go away for years and come back for a day or two. 

It hasn't gone on for this long (3 weeks). And I'm scared.. What if this time its different? Is it really still anxiety? 

I don't have time left to think about taking the vaccine.. I need to take it fast but i need more time for the palpitations to go away. It's going away, but every time i think about it, it comes back... And even more so when i think about the vaccine.

I've always had jitters on the daily ever since about three years ago but they didn't really bother me, it was just occasionally slapping/patting my back or the top of my head randomly if I felt happy or sighed really deeply. but about a month ago, I've been having these jitters really strongly, like I just start randomly slapping my face or hit my head to the point where it kind of hurts. I can hold back actually, and I especially do so at school, but it feels really uncomfortable to do so and sometimes it comes so suddenly or random that I just don't have the time to think twice about it. I feel like it's getting worse. yesterday I grabbed my cats hairbrush to brush him and I ended up literally striking my face with the metal bristles. I'm glad it didn't hit my eye. but today I randomly punched my face and it directed at my eye and it like, really fuckin hurt. also for some reason I just start clapping randomly? like I'll be studying late at night and I'll stretch a bit or I might be taking a piss and just, *clap* with my hands.

I kept thinking ""shit not here, this is the worse place to have one. What's going on I'm not even scared"" and I'm pretty sure my fear of anxiety caused me to have an anxiety attack.

 I was worried that the flight staff wouldn't understand and would force me to stay in my seat and I would be stuck there internalizing it (I really need to get up and get moving or it makes my anxiety worse. It's like I need to expel energy) luckily the staff was very understanding and even gave me oxygen to calm me down. Anyways I think I might be claustrophobic.

I recently broke up with my boyfriend for almost 4 years, and I realized it was one of the best decisions I've ever made. For the biggest part of that relationship, I felt like I was ignored to the point that I had to make clear that his behavior was bothering me and my already existing severe anxiety and depression became unbearable because he was holding me back, causing my anxiety and depression symptoms to thrive. I couldn't eat to the point I probably developed an eating disorder (I haven't been diagnosed with any), my sleeping schedule was a mess and and anxiety attacks were a daily thing, at least once a day. And, even though he was seeing my symptoms, he was stating that that ""psychotherapy is only for sick people"" and that I didn't need to go to a therapist because I was ""fine"" but, fortunately, I didn't listen to him and went to a therapist. Also, he was commenting negatively on everything I did, I said and I was, the worst being that the LGBTQ+ people are p@rverts, even though he knew I'm bisexual and it took me years to accept it. He was manipulative, closed-minded, jealous of all my male friends, he always wanted to know everything I was doing, showing me that he didn't trust me. His negative comments on my family problems were also devastating, making me feel even worse, but, even though I was telling him to stop reminding them to me, he ignored me. Anyways, it took me almost 4 years to finally see how toxic he was (a lot of other things happened but these were the worst) but I think it's better late than never, lesson learned.

They're taking forever to get this referral to go through and in the meantime, I'm suffering from panic attacks, anxiety attacks and these blasted skipped beats.  I doubt there's a medical cause like heart disease because when my stress is better managed and I get enough sleep they seem to disappear for the most part.  Plus, I had a normal ekg a few months ago.  I don't get chest pains with them, or shortness of breath or dizziness etc.  Never.

411,Anxiety_412,Scottishbiscuit,Anxiety,"Nails too long due to anxiety I see a lot of people who cut or bite their nails a lot due to anxiety but for me it manifests the other way. I used to always cut my nails really short because I wanted them to be even and organised. I would cut my nails like everyday. It became like an obsession to have them short. But because I was always cutting them really short and wanting them to be all the same, I would often end up cutting my nails too short and it would hurt. 

To combat this I started my nails so they would stop just at the top of my finger. When I cut them short I could just cut right along the edge and get it even but when I was cutting them longer I didn't have this edge which would mean it would take me a lot longer to cut them perfectly. Now it takes me over 2 hours to cut my nails because I have anxiety over them being perfect but because it takes so long and it's tiring, I don't like doing it often. As a result of this my nails grow very long to the point that they get in the way of me doing things and people are shocked that they are my real nails and not fake nails.

I tried searching up to see if there was any information about this but I only got articles about biting nails and cutting nails short. So I am wondering if there is anyone else who experiences this? 

I bought a Kalimba a couple days ago and it will need medium length nails to play so mine will be too long so I will have to regularly cut them which will take a long time but I can't cut them short because then they'll be too short.

Not that anyone would or does want anything to do with me that isn't forced to be with me like my parents; I assume they love me because of family, not that I'm deserving of love.

I have no passion, no aspirations or goals. I don't want anything from life except I guess for it to end. Been on lots of medications and tried several treatments but I just get worse and worse almost on a weekly basis.

I'm 22 years old, I've been suffering from anxiety and depression as long as I remember.
On april, my psychologist prescribed me zolof, xanax, inderal, onal.  I think 25 mg.
The first month was good, I was happy and normal.
But the second month which is now, I'm dying. I don't even know what I'm feeling.
I feel sleepy, scared and terrified, the feeling is so scary, I feel nauseated and I don't have apetite to eat anything.
I have no emotions and My body is trembling because I'm so scared and I don't know why. And I'm having serious suicidal thoughts which I did not have before
I feel like I just wanna stay home and lay down but the problem is that I just started a new job and new position and I'm also so overwhelmed about it and I can't take a leave :(
Please help me, I really don't know what to do. I'm so scared
* I'm going to a new psychologist today and tell her about what's going on, I really can't take this anymore",226
434,Anxiety_435,PeachxHuman,Anxiety,"Effexor XR vs Zoloft? I am to the point where I've had it with myself and my anxiety. I'm in therapy. Was previously for about 6 months and thought I was doing better and now have been back at it for 2 months. Therapy helps but I am reaching for something besides my benzos that make me super tired and brain dead when I need them. Luckily I maybe take one once a week so it's not a super common thing but has been going on for 2 years now and I just feel there has to be a better solution. I'm a woman with an already struggling sex drive so if I don't have to make that worse would be preferred (but honestly anything to keep me from spiraling in my thoughts until I complete therapy). 

I tried zoloft one night before bed and had a panic attack so I haven't touched it since but now I believe that was largely from scaring myself about serotonin syndrome. I also have a prescription for effexor which was the second round choice of my physician that I honestly haven't touched as I've been terrified to do so. 

I'll be talking to my doctor about what she recommends as she is a newer to me doctor that is still aware of my issues, just want to get some ideas of what works well for you guys, especially if you struggle from GAD/OCD/panic disorder. Thanks in advance for any opinions!",271

I have an upcoming trip and I'll be alone for the first time in 4 years. I used to solo travel no problem, but the pandemic really did a number on my anxiety. 

My problem isn't flying itself, I'm not afraid of airplanes, but that an airplane is the worst possible place to have a panic attack (which I've only had one bad one, but it was one of the worst things I ever experienced). And when I'm anxious it sometimes affects my stomach but while an airplane is taking off I'm obviously going to be confined to my seat. It's really only the takeoff that gets me, once the airplane is at cruising altitude I'm pretty much fine and landing is whatever. But it's similar for longer bus rides or basically anywhere where I'm not 100% in control.

A few months ago I smoked way too much weed and experienced extreme panic and paranoia. I felt okay for a week after and then the anxiety started. It would get to the same time of night it happened and my heart would start racing and I couldn't concentrate. One day after a night of drinking and worrying about losing control again I experienced extreme anxiety, panic attacks, depersonalisation and intrusive thoughts for 4 weeks. it was incredibly hard to even get up and shower.

I haven't experienced that level of anxiety since I began going to therapy. However I continue to worry about going crazy and losing control. I still experience intrusive thoughts which range from violent, to paranoid to downright ridiculous which cause me extreme distress. I still experience depersonalisation/derealisation (which makes me even more anxious/panicky). I also experience periods of irritability and have found my ability to concentrate has decreased dramatically which has been affecting my ability to complete uni work.

Other times, like at home, I feel like lashing out in a hostile manner, such as throwing or breaking items, or even hitting someone.

How do you deal with it? This is so much worse than my normal anxiety.

Both my parents drink a bit too much, my mum especially (but she gets defensive whenever I try to bring it up to her), and sometimes when they've both been drinking they'll get into a fight (which usually stems from something stupid my mum has said or done because she is drunk). When it is just my mum that has been drinking, she will still say stupid things or lie about something we all know is a lie, but we choose to ignore them. However when my dad has also been drinking, he'll latch onto something she has said and start a fight with her. 

Very rarely do these fights devolve into them yelling at each other, and only once has my mum locked my dad out of the house during an argument (this was a few years ago when their fights were much more common), they'r almost always pretty minor and end quickly... but every time they happen I have a panic attack and can't rest until I know they're both asleep.

469,Anxiety_470,RoguesTats,Anxiety,"Your Journey Is An Amends For context: I've had GAD since I was in middle-school and overtime I medicated said anxiety through drugs and alcohol. I truly believe my anxiety is the onset and culprit of most of my proceeding mental heath issues. It's the gateway illness that leads to a lot of negative in my life.

I was recently talking to someone who used to sit in on AA meetings for their undergrad nursing degree. One of the topics that stuck with them was steps 8-9. Essentially, make amends to people UNLESS these amends will cause them further harm. I, like most alcoholics/addicts, have harmed people closest to me. And I, like most alcoholics/addicts, want to make amends to those people closest to me. However, some of those people I would devastate even more.

I never grasped my anxiety. My anxiety turned to anger. My anger turned to recklessness. My recklessness turned to eventually consequences. Those consequences fueled anxiety and continued to provide energy to the loop.

I've recently decided to go to therapy to get a grasp on my anxiety. I've started writing more. I've started eating better. Drinking less. Facing my anxiety head-on. In short, I'm not letting my anxiety cause eventual fuck-ups anymore.

This journey is aligned with steps 8 and 9. I'm not apologizing to my loved ones verbally. I haven't written any letters. But I've hugged the cactus. I've through my journey of self-recovery and eventual improvement I've apologized in ways we've all wanted to do. Through action.

I'm hopeful one day I have the strength to confront my loved one's and verbally apologize. However, if your anxiety has led  you down a path that you look back on and cringe. And if you're embarrassed or feeling guilt from your anxiety, know that your path to getting better is making amends to not only yourself but your loved ones.

But anyways to start us off I have the issue of just not ever messaging any of my friends and then I wonder why they never do me I guess I also am always on Invisible so that doesn't help. I've lately organized myself in attempts to remove this fear. I genuinely am not in the mood to even talk to anyone despite it being the main goal of today. I sorta don't know how to go about this.

My logic beyond this is that I'm bothering them or something and sometimes if I get no response it's because they're not interested in me. Sometimes it could just because of the topic itself. I guess I do no good if I just send memes and expect responses. Maybe I should resort back to just asking a few questions to open a conversation of some sort.. Hmm. Idk this is my inner dialogue so I can't say I know how bad it is it could be much worse but atleast I'm trying to face it before I let it drown me. It already has though. I do find it easier within a group though to start conversations of some kind.

One more thing before I kinda like send this to reddit or whatever but like okay 2 things. I get annoyed by the fact that some other people won't DM me first and the people who do annoy me. I feel messed up. What do I even want at this point?

2nd thing was like.. I genuinely sometimes find it as if some friendships had a peaking point and now that it's lost or even after meeting someone for awhile that like it wouldn't be that way again or that like it's met it's expiration date as in they wouldn't even be interested to some extent.

477,Anxiety_478,realsim206,Anxiety,"Interesting insight Hey all,

First time poster here. I have been dealing with GAD for the majority of my life and been using a mixture of meds, meditation, Journaling, counseling etc to help combat it.

Anyways, I was meditating (trying to) the other day and noticed that I was actually doing my best.

Sounds crazy, but often when I meditate all I do is feel anxious that I am not doing it right, that I NEED to do it perfectly to feel less anxious and more prepared to enjoy my life when I am done. 

I did some Journaling after and came to the conclusion that the action and intention of just putting myself into a space where I can practice mindfulness is 99% of the battle. I don't think this just applies to meditation but really anything we are doing to help ourselves grow.

I feel like a lot of us try a bunch of things to ""conquer"" anxiety. I think in reality, being aware that we are doing our best in each moment helps alleviate the pressure to beat anxiety, and let's us accept it more than fight it.

Seems to me it really comes down to setting your intention (even if the mechanics aren't perfect in execution) and creating time/space to live that intention.

Sorry for the jumbled thoughts, but hope this can help folks.

Cheers.",260

I was 16 at the time and remember:

- Being drunk drove to the supermarket and being fully convinced we were gonna crash and die.

- Going to my dads flat once after several days of no contact fully expecting to find him dead.

- Constantly worrying that my dad was dead if he wouldn't pick up calls or answer 
messages.

-Worried he was gonna have a seizure when sobering up

- Worrying when i got home from school that he would be passed out on the sofa from alcohol

- When he was sobering up constantly feeling worried he'd go back out again 

- Having to take care of my Mum and little brother who were really struggling at the time. Worrying about them.

I never spoke to my family or friends about how i was doing at the time, i just remember putting on this happy mask when i wasn't at all, when things started returning to normal it was never really addressed. This was all 4 years ago now and looking back and seeing all this stuff i see how these are all deeply rooted in anxiety and worries, alot of repressed emotions what had to come out eventually.

515,Anxiety_516,Opposite-Discount340,Anxiety,"Anxiety and Obesity Looking to see if anyone has had a similar experience as me and/or some of my peers...

I've been overweight most of my life. I bonded with a group of friends who were also overweight. As we grew older we talked more about our mental and physical health. I developed gastrointestinal issues in college as a result of poor diet and heavy drinking. My friends developed other types of issues linked to their high weights as well. We realized it took a toll on our mental health. I contracted h pylori as a result in college and my stomachs never felt the same. Ever since that point and my behaviors in college I found that the usual butterflies in my stomach from nervous situations became terrible GI manifestations so to speak. I'd find myself with my heart racing, chest pressure, muscle tightness and tingles all over. I came to find out one of my good friends also developed stomach issues and anxiety manifested itself in a similar way. Where we'd find ourselves in a stressful situation and feel a subtle physiological sensation then suddenly our minds would race and the physical feeling would balloon out of control. 

My friend decided to lose weight not necessarily due to the anxiety but the obesity. What he found was that as he improved his cardio health, ate better foods, and shed the weight stressful situations would not cause an anxiety so intense. He did seek therapy and his therapist told him that a condition such as GERD, which triggers chest discomfort from heartburn, can cause the body to think something's wrong and trigger the nervous system reaction causing a panic attack. My friend found that through weight loss and addressing his stomach issues stressful situations went back to being just simple butterflies and not these intense physical manifestations that would cause him such distress.

So, basically I've developed anxiety (I think) in certain social situations. I don't think it's interacting with people that makes me anxious, it's the possibility that I may get sick.


I first noticed it a few months ago after I was sick to my stomach the day after drinking and I had to meet family for lunch. I spent pretty much the whole time in the bathroom trying to throw up but wasn't able to until later in the day after spending close to an hour in the car. It was a hellacious experience that I never want to go through again.


Now, it seems like my body is playing back that experience in nearly all sit-down social situations. I'm basically making myself sick worrying that I'm going to get sick.


I'm not sure if this is anxiety, and I'm certainly not sure what to do about it, but I know I don't want this (whatever it is) to dictate my social life.


Is this anxiety? If so, what type would you say it is? Lastly, if you've experienced something similar, was there anything that helped you to combat it?

But I just got a call from the therapist's office asking if I needed an appointment for a psychologist as well, as my therapist doesn't prescribe medication. I've always thought that you talk to a therapist first and then they'll recommend medication, so I'm a bit confused about the process.

What were your experiences with the order you did things? Should I make an appointment for the psychologist just in case?",140

Tired of me getting old in world that loves youth and beauty. Tired of having back pain, more and more teeth problems, grey hair, wrinkles, dark circles under eyes noone can help me with, I dont even have money for all this. I am so tired of every day life pressure, responsibilities, I have migraines. Everything gets more and more expensive and every day I think I should end it right here because it only gets worse. Prices, health, beauty, not that it used to be great but this face that looks at me in the mirror, that is just a shadow of happy, young, careless woman who I tried to be but never actually got there. I am tired of contant fight with weight too. +-20kg, every year. I am literally exhausted of life and I think it would actually be great to die sooner than reaching 40,50,60 and see myself older, uglier, teethless, or in more and more pain than I am now.

557,Anxiety_558,Queasy_Touch_5059,Anxiety,"What have I become? Looking back, I've always suffered from anxiety, since I was little.
The loss of my dad when I was a still a kid channeled my general anxiety into a more health anxiety focus.
Anxiety has ebbed and flowed over the years from one perceived drama to the next, but I could still function through it.

Then in 2020 I had a true medical emergency out of the blue. Although it was terrifying and required ambulance transfer and emergency surgery, the surgery resolved the issue and I was out of hospital 3 days later. 
Thought I was fine afterwards but my anxiety was building as I tried to ignore it.
5 months later, anxiety came in as I'd never known it before . 

Sudden Panic attacks which made me feel like I was dying , crushing fear of being in public incase I collapsed or something , physical symptoms of anxiety like i was on a boat deck- swaying as I walked, pressure in my head, so terrified of having something happen to me in public , I couldn't leave my house. 
my work was from home during the pandemic and that's the only reason I was able to continue to do it.

I'm Trying to leave my comfort zone now and the smallest things crush me with fear.

Volunteering at my nieces school canteen tomorrow because I didn't feel I could say no and I'm crippled with anxiety about it- when I'm anxious I get brain fog , can't focus, act like a bumbling fool and can't perform simple tasks like giving change from $2 for a $1.20 item. I'll count the money 5 times and still not register it, etc.
Although I've always suffered from Anxiety, these last 2 years have brought me to my knees, I feel like I can barely function as a person anymore",349
558,Anxiety_559,RiskAllin,Anxiety,"Anxiety is about the ones I love To most of my friends, I look like a normal person, going about my day. I have a good job (that I actually enjoy a lot), I am healthy and have a (small) group of friends who I am always in touch with. Sometimes i feel lonely, but nothing that anybody else wouldn't feel. But then, I decide to reach out to some friend, and if they don't get back to me right away my mind starts racing. I start thinking about them not liking me, never wanting to talk to me anymore, ignoring me on purpose. And I build scenarios in my mind saying ""screw them, I didnt even like them anyway and I will be better from this"" - a mere 2 days after not getting a response! And then time and time again, they do reach back out, and say they were busy, or didnt check their texts calls whatever. And I either think ""ooh thank god they got back, we are good"", or ""they must be lying, why dont they want to talk to me?""

And BY FAR, the thing that fucking sucks the most is that I am someone who doesn't care too much what random people think. I really dont give a shit if people look at me on the street, I feel no issue at all with interacting with strangers, no matter how goofy or weird the interaction may be. I actually find it very easy to talk to people, but for those (few) real friendships and relationships, I care so deeply about them and being friends that I always think the worst.

A couple of days ago I spoke to a former coworker on Facebook comment thread who I hadn't seen/spoken to in awhile. She sent me a message later saying to give her a call if I wanted to, and included her phone number. Even though it was obvious she wanted me to call, I had extreme anxiety about it and didn't make the call until tonight (the number was for a landline as this is someone of an older generation who doesn't really text or message. The message I received on Facebook was simply to give me her number -- she doesn't use Facebook or check her messages regularly, so texting/messaging instead of calling was not really an option).

I psyched myself up all day, and after supper I gave her a call. We had a lovely conversation and caught up a bit. It was the perfect length, and ended smoothly (no awkward ""who's going to hang up first"" pauses).

My issue now is I'm overanalyzing everything I said and how I said it. I get so nervous on the phone that my voice tends to get quiet and sort of ""dry"" sounding, and I feel like it's hard for me to express genuine emotion over the phone. For example, when she asked about my new partner, I said he was ""very nice"" instead of saying he's the most amazing person ever and treats me like gold. She seemed excited and happy for me, but now I'm thinking she probably hates him from that one little description. Little things like that, lol.

I'm a very light sleeper, on top of that I have anxiety and it is not helping. 

According to the rules of the school I'm in I need to live in this dorm for 3 more months, but I feel like my anxiety is killing me. I've never felt this scared in my whole life, I see no hope. Sometimes I can't even sleep at night because of the noise. Sometimes it happens that I am able to fall asleep but the noise wakes me up in the middle of the night and I can't fall back to sleep. I have classes in the morning and things to do throughout the day so if I don't sleep well I feel super tired and even more anxious. I never thought I would suffer this much, but this amount of fear that I feel throughout the day is horrible and I feel like no one can help me.

I have a severe irrational phobia of moths. I know it doesn't make sense and they can't hurt you. No I don't have the same fear of butterflies. I don't know why I have it I have been this way since I was a kid. 

When I say severe I mean panic attack and crying at the sight of a moth flying around. Particularly if it is near a place I need to go. 

Well tonight I went to take my dog outside before bed and when I opened the door to my apartment there was a moth flying around the ceiling. A large one. It swooped down towards my door and I screamed and slammed the door. It is an indoor apartment building - my door opens to a hallway not the outside world. I didn't know how to avoid this moth. I was terrified. My dog needed to pee. I but on a hoodie because that made me feel more protected and I opened my door again. This time it flew at my door. Nope. I couldn't do it. I slammed the door shut and began to have a panic attack sobbing and all. 15 minutes later I got the courage to try again, deciding that I was just going to open the door and book it with bug spray in hand and that I had to do it. I open the door and... the moth is gone. I spent so long crying that it left. I'd like to think that was the universe's reward to me for being willing to try.

But it was as the wrong decision because all this time my brother's autism caused his depression, suicide attempts, violence, so the doctors loaded him up with meds for that.

585,Anxiety_586,frostmas,Anxiety,"Why can't I trust my own decisions? I've always had an issue when it comes to deciding what I like.

If something interests me, I will research it (sometimes obsessively), like i'm looking for validation to like that thing. Then if I see the majority not liking it, I lose interest in it.


For example, If i'm enjoying a character in a video game and then I see that the majority of the players consider that character overpowered, I will refuse to play them. Even if I want to keep playing them, its like something in my brain is just anxious and it bugs me the whole time im playing as that character.


Thats just one example. I also struggle with even deciding what I like. Going back to the video game example, if I usually like bigger characters in games, and then one game I happen to enjoy a smaller character, it feels like I have a an identity crisis and start questioning myself. Like why do I like a smaller character if I enjoy bigger characters?


 Its like my whole identity starts falling apart when I dont like something I usually do, or if I like something I usually dont.

If I do name my anxiety, I considered naming him ""Bobby"" which is apparently my imaginary friend from childhood, although I don't remember Bobby at all. I grew out of imaginary friends around age 6 or so.

So the question is, does anyone do this? Does it bother you? Should I worry about ""Bobby"" or is it ok to ""name"" your anxiety, in the sense you 'remove' it from your true self as a way of dealing with it, sort of like you'd deal with a worrying child or something? Thank you.",193

This has slowly been getting better due to exposure (my job started making us come to the office part time and I have to take the train to work). Though it's getting better it still can be very stressful and one of my biggest fears is fainting while I'm commuting. I've fainted in the past due to stress/anxiety since I tend to hold my breath when very anxious.

Today, a man about my age fainted right in front of me. He just suddenly went down. Thankfully he didn't fall hard due to people around him breaking his fall. He was unconscious for about 2-3 seconds, then woke up seeming okay but a bit confused and embarrassed. People helped him up, gave him a seat so he could sit down, handed him napkins to wipe off the coffee he had spilt, asked if he was okay. He said he didn't know what happened and had felt fine and kept apologizing. Everyone told him it was okay and one lady offered to get off the next stop with him and go to an urgent care just to be safe. Before leaving the train with her he turned around and said ""thank you everyone"".

Y'all I watched my biggest fear happen right in front of me to someone else. And people were so nice. And helpful. And concerned. For this perfect stranger.

One thing that I really want to work on is how to stop waiting for things to be perfect to do things. Here are some examples:

* Waiting to reach my ""goal weight"" or to have a perfect hair day to wear cute or fancy clothes/makeup. I keep buying fancy clothes that I aspire to wear but I never do because I keep waiting for that perfect day to wear them. 
* Waiting to reach career goals, financial goals, travel goals, etc. before I start a family. This one is a huge source of anxiety for me. I finally reached my career goal and my husband and I are more comfortable financially. But I keep coming up with more things to reach before I have a baby. I am exploring this with my therapist too. It's not that I don't want kids - it's more that my anxiety is causing me to want to over-plan everything.
* Not using fancy bath products and makeup because I feel like I don't deserve them since I'm not at my goal weight.
* I wear the same hairstyle, same makeup looks, etc., but I keep buying new things because I want to try new things. But something keeps stopping me from actually wearing them.

The anxiety/fear is about me not being able to cope with the death(s). My thinking is like ""if I can't deal with everyday stress sometimes to the point where I get anxiety, how will I handle losing my parents?"", and even though logically I'm aware that it will happen sooner or later, when I have bad anxiety, this thought just lingers in my mind, mostly at nights.

My only ""experience"" with death was when one of my classmate's mom died when we were like 12. I'm in my early 20s now, and other than this case, I ""only"" had to say goodbye to family pets - that's probably why I'm worried/anxious about this topic.

For the last decade of my life(14-24) I've felt like I've always been a major overthinker and would have anxiety over the smallest of things, never had any panic attacks or anything of that sort.

Speed forward to early feb of this year and I got covid, I don't rememeber my symptoms being all that bad other than getting a bad panic attack. Recovered after and got back into weightlifting/running etc, no after effects felt really in any way.

And 2 hours after another And then the day after during work another. Since then I was prescribed anti-d's on Wednesday and haven't really felt the same since the last panic attack, just completely anxious in the entirety of my body, residual effects it seems.

652,Anxiety_653,Tree-Nui-Tee,Anxiety,"Found a way to tone down/cancel my anxiety attacks I recently got into a little habit. People always say that journaling helps with anxiety but it's not exactly the most convenient thing. I have these empty chats on WhatsApp made from various dead groups so it would just be me in it. I use them for various things like school stuff, pictures, sorting stuff etc. But the most useful one is my ‚ÄòSong of the Sea' one, named after a song I used to calm down. In that chat I got into the habit of ranting mainly because I have nobody to talk to about my issues. It being in that chat format makes things so much easier and relaxed than a designated app or something. This past week I made use of it during my anxiety attacks. Anxiety attacks usually consist of overthinking, a racing tornado of thoughts among other things. I was in a situation where I was forced to stifle my symptoms. I reached for my phone and typed. Typing what was on my mind forced me to get my thoughts into order. It was like sifting the debris out of the tornado so that it would be manageable. The end result would be a crazy long paragraph of thoughts or whatever was bothering me. Typing it out would also help me to make sense of what I was thinking, like, ""Would this scenario make sense? Is this logical? Can this actually happen?"" It would dial down what was blown out of proportion. After I get the anxiety under wraps, I'd put my breathing exercises into practice and that would dampen the flames which could've easily turned into a wildfire. Maybe I'll show my therapist someday so they could see my thought processes? Anyway, I just thought I'd share. Hopefully I helped someone! Have a great day/night everyone!üíú",351

I'm always just so worried that someone is mad at me, talking bad about me or thinks I'm a terrible or stupid person. It's incredibly crazy making and has really dwindled my self-esteem. I currently take Zoloft, but I'm not sure it's helping. 

In the past I'd go do something active to get my mind off of whatever it was I'd be obsessing over, but it hasn't helped lately. I guess I should also add that I'm getting married in a month and have been incredibly stressed out. So I'm sure that's not helping. I just wish my brain wasn't like this.",221

The first word that comes to mind is dizzy, but that's not really what it is. I've checked to see if it's bppv and it's not, but I did some maneuvers anyway but of course they did nothing. It's not really vertigo as I don't feel like I'm spinning, it's more of a sensation of crawling/buzzing/gentle motion inside my brain and body. It worsens when I close my eyes. I feel like I need to shake and tense my muscles when it happens. It doesn't really seem to be worsened by movement and I notice it most when I'm laid down. It's a super distressing sensation as it reminds me of something similar/the same thing I experienced last year when my anxiety was at the worst it had ever been.

I was worrying it was to do with my ears (I have health anxiety and I'm constantly fixated on my ears and vestibular system) as there's a loud crackling in my left ear when I swallow and whenever I ""pop"" my ears (hold nose and blow) the right always goes before the left, and when the left one pops it feels like I can hear loads of fluid moving around in there?

I am not talking about all the different types of anxiety but for mine this is the case.

For example: I quit my job due to anxiety 3 years ago. I was not able to touch my computer, I was having panic attacks when my boss was calling me. Constant pain every minute of every day. After 3 years, I can see that my ex job was not meant for me. It was too stressfull and it was not fullfilling for me because I wasnt feeling that path was the right path for me. However if I didnt get my anxiety/depression/burn out I would probably continue that path for all my life since I wouldnt be aware and continue autopiloting.

2nd Example: I started to see someone 3 months ago. I liked him a lot, but we werent compatible in terms of romantic relationship. I knew that but I said screw it I want him. Well there comes my anxiety relapse, not being able to sleep, thinking about him %100, not being able to concentrate on anything, heart palpations, chest pain... At the end he told me that he didnt want to worsen my anxiety so I was friendzoned. But my anxiety mostly vanished after this, I am sad ofc and again thinking about him, but now I can function again.

But what if I don't get the job and can't pay off my student loans which means I can't travel or purchase a car or start a family.  It would be so much easier to just die than continue to live like this.

Everything about the day was going smoothly. I was anxious and jittery and really dreading it, but I was pushing through and prepared to get it done. I arrive at the place, I go inside and everything is closed down for the day. I know the time, date, and location were absolutely correct. I wait for a few minutes before the panic sets in and I feel like I'm about to break down. All that stress and anxiety and preparation building up to this. I hurry back to my car and just sit there. I'm in full freeze mode, I'm upset, I'm angry, I don't know what I'm going to do next but all I want is time to stop and everything to stop. I know the interviews a bust at this point, I'm too frazzled and upset and I just want to get out of this situation. 

Now I have to deal with the next steps. Calling the interviewer back, setting up a new date, dealing with the fucking embarrassment and shame of it all. I'm just irrated and angry that it has to be this difficult, that things couldn't just go smoothly. I'm just dreading everything and I hate it because I don't have any coping skills for this and I never have. That's always how it is with me. I'm good until a hiccup and I have to change course and things aren't smooth and simple anymore. It makes me feel really depressed because I'm finally on a medication that I think works, but I guess only to help my day to day level of anxiety. It can't give me coping skills to deal with this.

Finally, about 2 years ago I decided to see my doctor and a therapist regarding my struggles. At that point I was seriously struggling with my university classes, struggling to sleep properly, struggling to eat, and having trouble maintaining my relationship and friendships. I cried myself to sleep almost every night, worrying about dying or a loved one dying. I couldn't let my mum leave the house because I was so scared she would die in a car accident. I felt terrible. I was diagnosed by my doctor with generalized anxiety, but I decided to not medicate myself. I probably only went to therapy for a few months because I ran out of insurance coverage, but I never stopped using some of the cbt techniques I learned in that short time. Slowly it's like, I can sleep, I can eat, I'm not irrationally afraid constantly. I also struggled with anxiety in regards to talking with people I don't know well. What I did to combat that fear, I got a job at a car dealership. I've never looked back. Talking to people is easy now, I'm described as ""outgoing"" which was never how I pictured myself. Truly, cbt and pushing myself outside my comfort zone actually changed my life. 
Genuinely I feel like for the most part I have left my anxiety at bay. 
One thing I still struggle with is the physical symptoms of anxiety that are still there and I don't think will ever go away. Randomly, at any little sliver at stress, my entire body gets covered in red blotchy patches. Its physically noticeable. This is the last thing I hope to change. I'm not even anxious, but I look like I'm upset because of my skin in public. It's the one thing that nothing I can do on my own will solve.",382

I'm devastated even thought I've only seen her twice. I don't do great with doctors and find that most (of any specialty) in the area where I grew up either just wanted to prescribe meds to get you out of their face or assumed you were an addict looking for meds. 

I'm terrified to go to a new doctor even though it's in the same medical group. My primary care says she thinks that patients will take well to the new doctor, but this is my first visit with my primary care (adhd &amp; anxiety made me procrastinate getting a primary care for over a year.

I have a master's degree from an extremely reputed institution, I was at the top of my class - like literally, I am the gold medalist, and I now work for an extremely well known and top of the class research organisation. Still, I can't seem to trust myself or my abilities and I always end up getting so nervous when conversing with people in and around my office (sometimes even friends too) that my voice starts shaking and I can't seem to talk or think straight and the anxiety doesn't leave my body for days as I keep ruminating on what happened. English is my second language and I've always been a little uncomfortable conversing in it. I also know that I judge people very harshly based on their writing and speaking skills - and I know I shouldn't - but I still do, and so I automatically judge myself too for not being good enough, for not being a good speaker. It gets even worse as I see people flawlessly talking to other people like nobody's business. It's come to a point where I consider leaving meetings because I have to just introduce myself! English is one thing, then I have body image issues too along with a deep distrust in my abilities. I remember this one time I gave a presentation and couldn't stop thinking about it for next 3 days because I thought that I'd somehow fooled everyone except my prof and he would know that I know nothing.

I want to be okay with who I am. I want to not spiral down the anxiety rabbit hole just because I fear talking or speaking up. I really want to stop caring so much about images, appearances, and materialistic virtues in general.

Over the past 2 years or so, I have been writing and recording meditation sessions themed around beautiful settings and those moments in nature where we all tend to find calm and contentment with our own minds.

These sessions are free and added to Guide; a free android app I created that also includes a meditation timer and journal for additional mindfulness practice.

If you are interested in checking out the free sessions and app, you can download it from the play store as a beta version. I have attached a link to a short form with the play store link in the description. Any feedback is most appreciated as I am trying to make this the best mindfulness app it can be.

Thanks so much! -Ken

- I was feeling so anxious that I couldn't sleep so I went to sleep with my mom (I also asked my therapyst what will happen when I won't have my mom anymore, she said that I would find another way to deal with it, it was helpful)

- I kiled two spiders :D yes it is an improvement because last time I saw a small spider in my room I didin't slept in there and I am very VERY scared of spiders

- Whenever I have intrusive thoughts or having an anxiety attack I find a way to distract myself (like talking to a friend, reading a webtoon, watching a movie and other things)

I am constantly anxious.
My hair has been falling out and thinning since that time.
I had to deal with a pretty condescending old dude landlord who talks down on me for wanting clear info / informing him about stuff.
I want to study social work and work in places where people can learn to reintegrate back into life, but I slowly feel like I shouldn't work there because I can't help them because I am in the same boat. Plus I still have to apply at plenty of places to hopefully be able to start in a month.
I also might have undiagnosed Autism Spectrum Disorder and ADHD which doesn't help and makes everything so damn hard.
Besides my boyfriend I have no friends and have never really been able to easily make friends or upkeep friendships.

I don't know how to continue. The logical solution seems to be to call a clinic or something to do intense therapy, maybe without studying for now but that would also mean confrontation and getting money from the state or something, idk. I just moved out, I don't wanna fail at it after day 2.

I have some pretty terrible insomnia, which leads to overthinking, which leads to obsessive thoughts, to anger, to depression. I hate this cycle and I want out of it. 

the only problem is, I used to beg my parents in tears to get me medicated to feel ""normal"" and they fervently denied my requests. they said that I'd become addicted to them, they don't really do anything, I'll be just as depressed and anxious when I come off of them, only weak people take meds, etc etc etc. 

I'm now a full grown adult who can make their own choices and I'm terrified to get medicated.

794,Anxiety_795,vintagevanilladream,Anxiety,"Getting help after years Hi y'all :)
So I've had undiagnosed anxiety since I was a kid but during my teens (late teens specifically), it's gotten progressively worse. It can get so bad that some days just walking around and paying attention in class is my biggest struggle and getting any homework done is a nightmare. Covid really made it worse and my anxiety gets worse every time there's a new wave where I am. 
For a couple of years, I've wanted to go to the doctor, actually talk to someone and figure out how to begin my healing process so that I can get better and a few months ago, I was really really close. I spoke to my school counsellor about doing this but then I got too anxious and nervous and decided not to go through with it, but tomorrow I'm going to be booking an appointment with my doctor to talk about it all and hopefully have a mental health plan. 

I just wanted to make this post to say that I've been struggling for years but I'm finally ready to begin my healing process and no matter how hard and scary it is, I'm committed. I also wanted to make this post to give anyone who needs help the words of encouragement you might need. It is so hard and scary, but you can do this for yourself. Just believe that you deserve to feel happy and take the first step, whatever that may be. I've got one more year of high school left so I truly felt like this was my opportunity because I have the support of so many teachers if I need it. 

Feel free to pm me if you want to chat. I'm going to try and have my booking in the next week so if you want to talk about that, or how your appointment went (which would be great because as excited as I am, I'm super nervous and scared still) or if you just need a friend/understanding support, I'm here.

795,Anxiety_796,Wichita92,Anxiety,"What if your anxious thought comes true? I have severe health anxiety, but not always about something that's going to kill me. More so anxiety around changes that will cause debilitating or drastic life changes (hand tremors, diabetes, etc)

I was so scared I had diabetes out of nowhere despite having years of ""high"" normal fasting glucose tests. Well - one day I gave into my anxiety, got a test and boom - I was well into pre-diabetes territory despite being only mildly overweight.

Now I got all panicked - did a crash course diet and my number came back down. But this day reaffirmed something - it made me realize that if i wasn't anxious about my health and got a glucose test that I could have moved into the diabetic range given how fast my number shot up. My anxiety led me to discover something that ended up being my fear all along.

From this day forward I became paranoid - the next 2.5 years of my life have been an absolute disaster with panic attacks regarding health become more frequent. I now have developed visual snow, my tinnitus has gotten worse (which I realize can be due to anxiety) and my hand tremors have become significantly more noticeable (which I originally chalked up to anxiety, but then read about essential tremors and now believe that I have a progressive condition).

I don't know where to go from here...now that my mind saw my anxiety helped prevent something, it's like it refuses to believe it could be wrong now. 

I could really use some friendly advice. I should mention in addition to anxiety, I have been clinically diagnosed with ADHD and OCD. Things like meditation are extremely difficult for me.

For example, when I get into my car after a social interaction, I would hyperventilate and start gagging. I would analyze my conversation and then my mind would telling me that I was stupid for saying this or doing this. Basically mentally bully myself till I cry.

But then COVID happened which reduced my gagging since I had little to no interaction with people, and even if I did, I had a mask to hide my gagging mouth. 

However, I knew this was getting worse when started gagging after hanging out with my cousins. This is weird because my cousins are my only friends, and I feel comfortable with them.

Unfortunately when speaking to doctors I have very bad phone anxiety especially before I finally make the call. So, my annual follow up scan is getting close and I'm starting to thinking of postponing it for as late as I can. It's more than one doctor that I have to deal with/call and many procedures I have to go through before the exam. Weird thing is that I like having discussions with my doctor when in person but the anxiety kicks in hard even weeks before I make the call making me unable to do things other than be stressed and think of the moment I need to make the call.

This is gonna be my first time posting something on Reddit so I apologize in advance.  


Lately, my anxiety is getting worse. Well, I used to have anxiety way back years ago. Probably 5 or 6 years ago? That I'm not sure.  


I used to go therapies as well with a counselor. I remember asking her before very straightforward: ""Is this ever going to disappear? How long can I go back to my normal life? Where I was fearless and not having these attacks?""  


Then she answered back on a graceful way: ""You'll learn how to control it.""  


Have you ever heard something like that before? Where it sounds so hopeless and at the same time hopeful? Very cool, huh?  


But yet, what she said was 100% correct. It didn't disappear, but I learnt how to control it.  


I controlled it for 6 years and didn't bother me at all. However, for the past few days. It started coming back and much stronger. This time, I'm now waking up in the middle of the night with my thoughts racing so fast. It's like my brain is thinking fast that I'm afraid I won't be able to control it. 2 nights ago, I woke up and what I felt is that like I wanted to cry and shout but I don't know why I would cry and shout.

 ""Psychiatrists don't even want to think about it."" Also have seen some Maurice Fava articles on this one can find by Googling Fava's full name.

I spend a lot of time alone and inside my house doing activities related to my studies of pretty much whatever hobby I have, like reading, watching tv, drawing, etc. I do go out for college class and some sports lessons mostly, also to hang out with friends in each other's homes. But every time I have to go out to someplace and maybe take part in an activity that I don't usually do, I start getting nervous days before. I just start thinking going around everything that will take place like how I'll get there, which way would be the best to get there, will I get there on my own or with someone else, how long will actually be there, etc. And while this has never made me avoid going out, it certainly makes the days before very complicated and uncomfortable for me. 

Apart from that, my mind can't shut up for one single second for the entirety of the day. I could be doing literally anything and I will keep thinking and analyzing my life. It's like I am constantly giving myself a pep talk, or asking myself if I'm actually happy and what can I do to change that in case I am not, just overthinking my life and everything I do. And I don't know if giving yourself a pep talk for example would be something related to anxiety, but I'm sure it's not common to do it every day at whatever random moment; if anything it's getting annoying but it just keeps happening in my mind and I don't know how to control it.

913,Anxiety_914,MaTArcher,Anxiety,"Separation Anxiety My last two breakups over the past years have generated what I believe to be ANXIETY. I read the symptoms and descriptions of what anxiety seems to feel like and how it manifests itself and I'm convinced that I am experiencing levels of it. It comes in waves and creates a vertigo feeling above the stomach / sternum area. It seems to induce night sweats occasionally. It paralyzes my ability to be comfortable in social situations because I tend to have difficulty following conversations as I am busy ""feeling"" that internal pain. Any type of excess noise or disturbance that I would usually tolerate seems aggravated and becomes untolerable. Eyesight becomes a bit blurry when at its peak. It causes me to be dysfunctional at work.

To better understand, this anxiety seems directly generated by the separation with a romantic partner. It seems that even though the separation takes place on an agreement level, as in I (my head) understands that the relationship has come to an end and that the decision to end the relationship is the right one, there is still a LARGE amount of anxiety generated by the thought of this person ""exiting my life"". The circumstances in which the anxiety is amplified is ruminating on the fact that this person may never contact me again, has moved on OR has met a new partner within a short period of time after the breakup. Keeping a former partner on social media seems to amplify these thoughts, as soon as a new profile picture is posted of them seeming happy it makes it worse so I have disciplined myself to mute/delete/ignore everything related to them on those platforms.

I reach out to this sub reddit to see if there are ways to cope but also eliminate these irrational thoughts and stop building anxiety over them. 

Thanks",335

About 3 months ago, I started getting panic attacks where I feel a shivering sensation in my chest, I get really cold, get muscle twitches in my legs and and start uncontrollably shaking. I have never had such severe physical reactions to anxiety before and sometimes they'll just come out of nowhere when I'm not even anxious.

To put it shortly, I learnt my two relatives (uncle and grandmother from same side of the family) were schizophrenics, so technically speaking, I'm prone to inheriting it. 

Since I've known this fact, I question almost every little abnormality, sometimes I see a little flash of light, sometimes I hear all little noise when falling asleep and I don't know if it's hallucinations or not. This causes me great anxiety, and then I get anxiety from the anxiety (because anxiety can be a symptom of the disorder) and the inability to think clearly is also a trigger, thus the feedback loop.

In addition to regular headcold symptoms, I've also had some stuff that's pretty common when I'm having issues with anxiety - chest tightness, rapid pulse, nausea, lightheadedness, stuff like that.

Since those are all reasonably also symptoms of just being sick, and I haven't really felt mentally anxious at all, I've just assumed that this is a particularly shitty cold. But this morning it was a little worse than usual, and I decided to take an ativan to see if it would help. And it did - not for the headcold stuff, but for the other stuff.

Hence the question in the title. Basically, does the fact that the ativan made me feel better mean that anxiety is causing this, or would ativan help with those kinds of symptoms regardless of what's causing them?

The best way I can describe it is that it feels like I'm being hit with an emotional firehose. There is usually some visual expression of moving shapes and I always feel it in my body. My internal voice becomes loud and hostile. My hands seem to grow, and every breath and any movement feel very violent and loud (even though my breath is very shallow by now and any movement is slight). I always try to stay in this place and take the proverbial beating until it passes. This can take up to 30 minutes sometimes.

i know this isn't anything unique because DPDR is a symptom of a panic attack, but goddamn it's the worst — and perhaps even worse is the fact that once it's happened, that lingering fear of another panic attack/dissociation is always present.

That's where I started to experience severe anxiety again. Then, after I passed and went back to school, suddenly there was this enormous amount of new material we had to swot. After that, my now ex boyfriend (I wish him sand in his bedsheets) broke up with me and a group people I called ""friends"" decided to ghost me.
So yeah, some stuff has happened.

I was such a wonderful time, I even sprung for a bottle of Cristal. A great memory. On New Year's day 2020, my dad told me he had pulmonary fibrosis and had 3 - 5 years left. 51 days later I was giving his eulogy üò•",91

So I recently (after biting my nails down to the point where they bleed) decided to attempt to grow them out.

It actually hasn't been going too badly. However, I've started picking at my cuticles. To the point that they bleed. (if you pick at your cuticles you know exactly what I mean.) And even the skin below my cuticles that feels ""pickable"". It's gross, I know.

When I take my anti anxiety medicine it really helps and I don't even think about it. But I try not to take it everyday, as my doctor repeats ""it can become addictive, remember that.""... I've got enough problems in my life. 

I've thought about buying that stuff they have that you put on your nails that tastes gross and is supposed to deter you from anything concerning your nails; but I know that wouldn't stop me from biting my them (I was a thumb sucker for a loooong time and that stuff definitely didn't stop me.)

how in the hell do i quit this, or start to? It's painful and embarrassing that my fingers look the way they do.",244
999,Anxiety_1000,jollyroger678,Anxiety,"Tips to stop picking! Because of my anxiety I'm very fidgety and do something with my hands at all times. Unfortunately, I tend to pick at my cuticles/face/scabs until they bleed. I also work in a chemistry lab and it would be great if my cuts don't come in contact with the chemicals I use (I do wear gloves most times but it would be nice not to). I've tried little fidget toys and they do help a little but I still can't break this habit.",98
