My husband would like us to do some activity with our friends 2 times a month. This would mean we have to send our little girl to be babysat at her aunt's house (my husband's sister) We already send her to her grand parents 1 or 2 times a month to go to the movies or things like that.

Is that too much babysitting? I feel uncomfortable to leave her with relatives so often! I sometimes feel like my husband just want to get rid of the kid every week...


Am i overprotective? Is it too much babysitting for a 4 month old?


edit: I live in Quebec and everybody has a full year of paid maternity leave... babies are not often seen in day care centers here :)


edit2: Thank you all for your answers. It feels great to put things in perspective. Tonight she will go to her aunt's while we have friends coming over to play board games. I know that she will do great, because she usually does when she is babysat (tough is the first time for the aunt, so I'm a little bit nervous, but she lives 5 min away anyway...) So yeah, i think we gonna send her over 2 times a month like my husband wants. If it doesn't work well, we will just stop it.

My almost 7 year old son, who has Aspergers, is starting a new day camp next week. We've spoken to the councilors an given them as much background as we can. The question came up of whether or not to be up front with the other kids - for example, on the first day reading them a book about Aspergers ([maybe this one](http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1843102064/ref=oss_product) ). This could be done in the context of each kid telling something unique about them self. My son is very open Aspergers, and would have no problem doing that. 

People on the ""against"" side, have concerns that it would be singling him out and may cause more problems and teasing.

People on the ""for"" side point out that the kids will pick up fairly quickly that my son is ""different"" and being up-front about what that difference is and how they could help could prevent problems. Also, they point out that if a child had a physical disability you would certainly talk about it, e.g.  ""Billy has a XXX so he would be able to go swimming with us, but he loves to sit on deck and you can still play ball with him that way"".

So what do you think?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(x-post from &lt;a href=""/r/aspergers""&gt;/r/aspergers&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;

At the carousel I had to pick up a large suitcase and his carseat, which was no easy task while carrying an excited little boy who wants to get down and walk. People watched as if they pitied me while I struggled to stack the carseat on the suitcase while holding a sqwirmy baby.

I blew off the looks and masterfuly maneuvered baby and luggage to the cart check-out (which don't have baby seats in them) to check one out and make the tow to the parking garage easier. The carts cost 3$ so I dig through my backpack for my wallet, as luck would have it I didn't have enough 1s, but I had a 10 when the machine only accepted 1s and 5s.

In the 2 1/2 weeks it's been since we all learned the term Tiger Mother I've oscillated wildly between thinking the woman is a saint and a demon. Her tough-love approach certainly produced the desired results, children who can out-perform their peers in the few narrow fields she chose for their education. We can debate the merits of her choices for those fields, and her methods endlessly but I'll leave that to other threads.

The itch that's been under my skin ever since is this: She tells us this is a superior way to raise children.

But that's just it, she's raising successful **children**, not successful adults. 

In the end every child grows up to become an adult, and I don't see how what she's doing is helping her girls become successful members of society. I know plenty of people who can focus on a task obsessively for hours reaching for perfection: they suffer from Autism spectrum disorders and cannot hold down a paying job because they cannot work with others.  The real world we live in demands we communicate and cooperate with those around us and those very things that Amy Chau derides: sleepovers, school plays, extracurricular activities are what help us to form those vital important social skills.

He is almost 13 which I think is pretty close to the age when I first ""hated"" my own father.

I'll have to do a follow up after the showdown this weekend.  There will even be police.  Should be interesting.


***DETAILS(edit):

Okay, sorry. I'll try to make it short.

Basically he is pissed at me because of some legal stuff between his mom and myself (we've been apart for 10+ years). He started off by not wanting to come to my house for my parenting time. So, like an freakin' idiot trying to be a cool dad I let it slide. 10 weeks later he stomping his foot and still saying that I can't make him come over. I'm supposed to have him every weekend and haven't seen him for 2 1/2 months. During that time we were trying to do counseling (he and I) to get it worked out. After 3 sessions he stomped his foot again and refused to go.

Soooo, I finally laid down the law - literally. Told him I was picking him up this Friday and that was that. He stomped his foot and said ""you can't make me"", but it turns out that ""YEAH I CAN"". So i told him that and also how I was going to do it. It involves the police and a neat little thing called a Civil Standby (Civil Assist).

Hence the "" I hate you!!!""

It's a bit more complicated than that, but does that help clear it up?



**Second Edit:

The worst part is that he really is a great kid.  Just in a difficult and emotionally trying spot that came with really lousy almost a teenager timing.

Just as I type this, my son is upstairs in his room screaming and screaming and screaming at the top of his lungs.  His bedtime is about 8:00pm and it is now 9:25pm.  It's like this every single night now.  There never used to be any kind of problem getting him to sleep.

I'm pretty sure he is teething right now but the baby Oragel seems to do NOTHING!

He refuses a bottle, he refuses a pacifer, he refuses me talking softly to him... nothing.  He just screams unless I pick him up (which I don't think I should do).

He's done this at least the past week and I'm getting real tired of dreading this time of night every single day.  My wife is at work so I'm on my own here. 

Can somebody please help a father in need!?  What do I do!?!?

***EDIT &gt; UPDATE!

**Well from what I'm seeing here I've been completely wrong about the ""let them cry"" method.  It obviously wasn't working anyways.  I went ahead and just picked him up last night from his crib and the crying immediately stopped.  While he was in my arms, I looked down at him and the little turd started laughing at me.  Laughing at my misery in putting him to bed!  I gave up in the bedroom and we went downstairs and watched some TV together.  Then he fell asleep within 30 minutes like a champ.**

Up until about a year ago she spent her days with her grandparents. Then they left the country for a while, and she started daycare, which she enjoyed... she had no issues being away from us all day. Her grandparents came back in February, and at the same time, her little brother was born. She went back to staying with the grandparents during the day for the whole spring; then in the summer, grandparents had to leave again. During the summer she started to throw tantrums, especially around eating, but we took it in stride, dealt with it, and things got better. She doesn't do that anymore, though like a lot of kids she just doesn't like to eat much. But she gets enough nutrition.

Her grandparents (who live with us) have been back again since September, and ever since, she panics whenever grandma leaves the room, unless it's just part of her routine. Routine separations are no issue; she's all smiles when mom and I leave for work in the mornings, she goes to bed without fussing. But if someone has to step out unexpectedly, she breaks down.

Last night grandma had to run an errand. In the midst of crying, my daughter sprinted across the room and tripped, of course prompting sympathy from grandma.

* I had laid him in the center of the bed and turned around to grab his shirt. My back was turned for, perhaps, two seconds. Yet he managed to roll off the bed.

* He landed on his belly.

* He started howling immediately.

* I immediately picked him up and soothed him. After ten or fifteen seconds, he calmed right down. Breastfed just fine. Was laughing and smiling before bed.

* We did a pupil dilation check with a flashlight several times yesterday and today and he seemed normal. Rotated his limbs and checked for any swelling or sensitivity. All was fine. Sleep was normal.

How long do I need to be terrified? How can I tell if this has retarded my kid? Can a concussion take awhile to take effect? And are there any additional checks I should run within the next 72 hours that may not be found on pediatric websites?

For me, the triplets (two months old at the time) were having reflux/vomiting issues.

Not only does this not help with the vomit they stop pooping. Now they had been pooping at just about every feed (every three hours, give or take). They actually wanted me to keep feeding them that shit for three more days before stopping. Fuck that, I thought. I stopped the rice and they're still having issues a couple weeks later with BMs.

We've periodically been giving them Karo syrup, which helps. But it also means they go almost an entire day poop-free and then have a fucking blowout.

On top of that, I just read in my premie book that feeding any kind of solid food is epically bad for any baby younger than 4 months. WTF?

I don&amp;#39;t think our local baby stores have them in stock where I could look at them and see if they&amp;#39;d work. And I really don&amp;#39;t want to have to deal with shipping a return if I buy one online and it doesn&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#39;t just take off one side of the crib since we&amp;#39;d have no way of securing it. I mean, it would probably work, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t trust it. We could put the mattress on the floor like I intended to to start with, but I wanted to get the kit so that we could put the crib right up next to my side of the bed for the next one (which we aren&amp;#39;t planning on anytime soon, but I knew I&amp;#39;d have trouble finding the kit if I waited until we were).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, is there anything I can do besides what I&amp;#39;ve mentioned here?&lt;/p&gt;

I am looking for some outside perspective to a situation I'm in.  I'll try to keep short because this could get long quick, but I'll answer any questions anyone has if it helps to provide better feedback.

I asked my ex if I could take my son &amp; daughter to a family dinner with my parents &amp; my fiancee's parents on xmas eve.  She said only if I also bring two other children that were the result of her and the guy she ended up with after our divorce.  The reason behind this is because she says she doesn't want any of the kids to feel excluded.

The problem I have with this is that these two other kids have no discipline at all.  I have tried including them before but they require so much work, I end up chasing them around trying to keep them from hurting themselves or getting into stuff that I don't get a chance to spend any quality time with MY children.  I suspect this is how the xmas dinner would go too.  To her (the ex) credit, she did say she'd come pick them up if they got out of hand and didn't listen.

The ex is a total control freak and this is just another way I feel she is trying to make it hard for me to move on with my fiancee.


In the end, I have a feeling I will have to just ""lawyer up"" to have a visitation schedule drawn up (did not have one from divorce), but that will probably have to wait until I get my tax returns.

165,10779,Parenting,1326558524,mariogirl819,ogv3e,Kid #2. What should I expect from my 1st?,"This is my first ever post on Reddit. We just found out we are pregnant with #2 due in September. We have a son that will be turning 2 in August. I have a lot of questions regarding potty training, moving to a toddler bed, and acceptance of the new baby.

1. I know every child works at their own pace and I have gotten my first to understand what a potty is. He will even go sit on it if I ask him where it is but he hasn't figured out the whole going in the potty thing. I would love to have him potty trained before the new baby comes. I have heard of kids reverting back when a new baby comes.

2. Switching to a toddler bed has been on my mind recently because he is just starting to attempt to climb out of his crib. He hasn't gotten out yet but its inevitable. I've heard of people just putting a mattress on the floor and then of course the toddler beds. 

3. Lastly acceptance. Right now he is a big mommas boy. Sometimes he is ok if I hold another baby and sometimes he isn't. I know sometimes this sort of situation has to do with if the kid is getting enough attention but that isn't his issue. 

If anyone has any tips for any of these things I would greatly appreciate it. I don't have many friends that have 2 children (let alone 1) so I can't hear from first hand experiences. 

TIA

I am an intern working with a non-profit agency, helping to facilitate support/education groups for teen parents (ages 14-22). Most of these parents are low income and rely on some form of government assistance. I am in my mid 20's and have no children, and my experiences with and knowledge about kids are largely from what I've learned in my various child development classes. I was hoping the redditors in [/r/parenting](/r/parenting) might have some good suggestions regarding potential topics, or websites/books that are beneficial (for both me, and the group members!). 

We have a basic curriculum that covers topics such as bonding, nutrition, home safety, and resume writing for the parents. I hope to add something more to these groups, which is hard when it's a non-profit with basically no money to spare for books or supplies. I'm looking for what lies beneath the typical websites that pop up on a google search. I have ideas for topics such as discipline techniques and relaxation methods, but I think the minds of parents would be much better in generating some useful ideas.

Mainly for financial reasons, for it didn't make sense for her to work only to hand most of her earnings to the daycare. It's been 2 months now, and she doesn't seem to be very handling it very well even though our 3.5 yr old goes to preschool 3 days a week. These are the days she looks forward to as they don't seem too stressful. The days she's got all three is an entirely different story. When I get home from work, she's just ready to quit. I take over and let her deal with just our youngest. I don't blame her, for I can't imagine staying home with our kids like she does. I love my wife dearly, and it really concerns me since she dreads starting her days.

I've looked at the numbers again, and found that we would be about 7K ahead if she goes back to work. That's if she works full time. I've been hinting to her that maybe she wants to consider going back to work. But I think she feels like a bad mother if she does, and will not consider it.  She's a great mother and wife, but I fear the stress is going to get to her. All I can do is assure her to give it some time, and maybe she's find a rhythm with this stay-at-home gig. And hopefully it won't be as stressful anymore.

My question to anyone who's experienced this is. Does it get better for her?  Or should I insist that she start looking for a full time job?

When I tried to put the sandwich into the sandwich bag, the top wouldn't stay on. I removed the cucumber from the sandwich and it seems to be holding up, but kind of deformed the star shape. I'm also worried it won't hold up until 11:30 tomorrow morning.

From the day my daughter was born, oftentimes when I hold her, or she crawls on me or even touches my face gently, I get a partial boner.

* Reconsidering your requests- problem may be in what you are asking your child to do  
* Putting the relationship first- creates comfort to talk and trust  
* Loving unconditionally- show children they do not have to earn parent's love  
* Asking how things seem from child's point of view?  
* Being authentic- apologize, do not act infallible  
* Talking less, asking more

These parents would just strike up conversations with each other about the simplest things (kids schools, childhood stories, comic books, etc..). I was just standing there feeling like the odd one out. Other people must think I am rude for keeping to myself. I am afraid that my behavior will start hurting my children as they start making friends or joining sport teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thank you everyone for the really good advice. I&amp;#39;m happy to know I&amp;#39;m not alone.
Can anyone relate?&lt;/p&gt;

243,15229,Parenting,1334381820,ailli,s960k,How do you stress the importance of honesty to a 7 year old?,"Background: I've known my boss' daughter literally since she was born.  Because I'm only 18 years her senior, I've become a pseudo-aunt/sister to her, since I see her fairly often. 

So, my ""niece"" is 7, and she's just started testing her lying skills. She generally gets caught, because, luckily, she's a piss-poor liar. 

The only problem is that when she gets caught in a lie (and gets punished), we can't get her to understand how her previous lies undermine our ability to trust the things she says in the future. Usually it goes something like this:

Her: But I'm telling the truth this time!
Us: You just lied to us; that makes it a lot harder for us to believe the things you say in the future.
Her: But THIS time it's really the truth! You have to believe me!

How can we deal with this without giving her the impression that she's a bad kid/totally unworthy of trust?

For the most part she's a pretty awesome kid, and we've found some really awesome behavior-management techniques that seem to work out for us. She has ADD - for which she is medicated - but she STILL has days at school where her teacher is completely exasperated with her. I introduced her to WarCraft (her parents were an interesting combination of horrified and awed that she clearly understood how to play), and we struck a deal that for each ""good day"" she had, she would earn ten minutes of time to play WarCraft, for up to one hour a week (bonus ten minutes if she's good all week). That worked incredibly well; she's up from two good days a week to four or five. 

So we're fine with creative/unusual systems; we just need some advice as to how to break her of the lying (and over stupid shit!) before it becomes a major problem.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background: I&amp;#39;ve known my boss&amp;#39; daughter literally since she was born.

He seems to like sweets a lot and throws tantrums on a daily basis if he doesn't get what he wants.  Chips, cookies, juice, more juice, milk, and maybe some meat here and there.

I know I an adult and my kid is only 2 years old.  I know am the responsible party for his well being.  But I don't know how to get him off his old ways and make sure he eats a healthier variety of foods.  Is ""starvation"" an ideal way to go about this?

I was hoping that some of you might be able to share some insight, advice or similar stories with me about getting preggers the second time around.

My wife and I were very carefree during our first few years of marriage in regards to protection.  We never used any.

In all that time we never got pregnant but then we decided that we wanted to have a kid so, on the the advice of a friend, we bought some of ovulation sticks to tell us when my wife was ovulating and the first time we gave it a serious go - success!

Now we have an adorable little boy who will be two next month.  Best thing I have ever done in with my life.

When we had our boy my wife had a C-Section and she has since been ""checked out"" by an OBGYN who tells her that everything so be a-okay for a second.

So - for the past 4 or 5 months we have been giving it another go using the same method as before.  When the ovulation stick says ""go time!"" we have been going at it.  A LOT!  It's exhausting honestly.

But here we are - 5 months in and nothing.  

Just this week we were late a couple of days and were optimistic but literally, as I was at the store buying a pregnancy test, my wife got her period.

She is quite distraught about it.

Is it supposed to be this hard the second time around?  

Any advice anyone can share on making things more successful?

Should I try to change it or try to move in this terrible housing market?,"My oldest is in kindergarten and I've heard too many stories just in the first weeks that give me that terrible sinking feeling about this school (public).  I know that kindergarten doesn't make or break your life or anything, but I've got two more kids coming down the pike in a couple years.

The housing market where we live is not great, as in many places.  So while moving is possible, it won't be a smooth or easy thing to do.  We might be able to swing it without losing money.

But what can a set of working parents really do to improve things?  We're on the PTA, but the problems really seem to be more systemic and began even at registration; such as repeatedly giving out unclear or erroneous information or giving it in an untimely manner, lack of control when big groups of kids are together, using screaming and shouting to communicate with the kids far too often.  Kids are peeing on the floor in the bathrooms.  There is an unconscionable lack of supplies and space.  They don't allow kids to talk in the lunchroom if they've finished eating, they make them put their heads down on the table (which seems wrong, but I haven't been there to figure yet why they do this).  There are two classes of 30 kids each in one room together.  I'm sure that individually, most teachers are perfectly fine.   But the school is overcrowded and underfunded and that seems to have led to acceptance of a culture that is mediocre.  Or are my expectations out of whack?

Of course, things may improve as the year goes on, but planning to move takes a huge amount of forethought and organization (for us, anyway).  So - should we stay or should we go?

I'm not entirely sure this is the most appropriate subreddit but it was a toss up between here and 2XC so I figured it'd be more relevant here.

My first niece was born yesterday. Her name is Aisling. She is awesome. I want to get her something special but I'm pretty much cashless at the moment (also, it seems the generic gift is a pale pink item of clothing that she'll outgrow in two weeks and I want to get her something more personal she can hold on to).

I'm entirely new to this whole baby malark. Can anyone suggest something appropriate that I can be a bit creative with? My artistic skills are okay if a little rusty. Also, I can sew but none of that cross-stitch or knitting business - although I can weave on a little homemade loom (nothing too elaborate though). I'd love to make her something like [this](http://gizmodo.com/5434692/how-to-make-your-baby-a-genius-the-science-quilt) but that's way out of my league.

Your ideas would be greatly appreciated. If I make anything half decent I'll post photos of her with it when it's done.

EDIT: Thanks for all the great suggestions. I've started on a teddy bear for her and also ordered a little crystal prism to hang in her window to make rainbows.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Parents,&lt;/p&gt;

I'm fine continuing to nurse him as long as he wants, up to about age 3 or so. I'm not opposed to tandem nursing if he's still at it when Kid #2 arrives.

While I am asking grandparents and my sons doctor, i decided to ask fellow parents on reddit.

My 8 week old son (first child) woke up 6 times screaming, but screaming followed by crying. I guess its my parenting nerves but it scared me. 

It took a few minutes to calm his down and he would go back to sleep. Before this his usual night time schedule was just waking up at 3am for milk and diapers.

But last night it seemed something was scaring him. We are in Bolivia and beliefs here said that we should ""call his spirit back"" (a custom in which you close doors and wave his hat motioning his spirit to return, I dont believe but wife does and called him back last night). It did not help.

Right now it is morning and baby is awake and normal. I am trying to plan for tonight.

When son was born there was medical malpractice and becuase of that he was in intensive care for 2 wks and home on oxygen afterwards.

But now has the best team of doctors money can provide here.

Anyone know what to do with baby being scared in sleep?

Also, we do not fully turn off the lights in room, they are dimmed. He also prefers to sleep between me and his mother and not in his crib.

Thank you in advance for your replies.



**edit** well this evening he started screaming again. We kept his doctor in loop all day and doc said its colic. Gave him drops to help stomach and happy to say so far son is sleeping for 1.5hours and counting in my arms without waking. He looks to be at peace. Thank you everyone who responded.

Pros: 

She will have a very light scar by the time she is school

She is too young to mess with the 2-3 stitches

Since she is young she only needs local anesthetic instead of general

It is only a 15-30 minute in office procedure depending on how much dermis they have to remove (they have to get all the affected tissue)

Having it removed doesn't decrease the chance it won't come back or spread

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday when picking him up from the babysitter (where both the kids go every weekend...gosh I&amp;#39;m lucky), he started throwing a tantrum because daddy took a piece of chocolate away from him. He threw himself on his butt and started screaming, and instead of ignoring him, Auntie (babysitter) picked him up to comfort him. Could this be why ignoring him doesn&amp;#39;t work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance guys! I&amp;#39;m looking forward to hearing your opinions and similar experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

Our child (20 months old) is having a coughing fit + endlessly dripping nose.  The coughs can get violent/deep at night.  I don't know if the use of the wood stove insert and the coughs are related but I think the use of the wood stove insert isn't helping much.

It's a non-catalytic style but has a reburn chamber (Wolf Steel/Napoleon insert).  It's EPA emissions is 3.5 G/HR (http://www.epa.gov/compliance/resources/publications/monitoring/caa/woodstoves/certifiedwood.pdf).  

I've read some studies that seem to indicate that using a wood stove or insert can introduce tiny particles that don't get filtered by the nose/airways and can essentially lodge themselves in lungs.  The studies seem to also associate using a wood stove with increased cases of bronchitis, chronic bronchitis, and pneumonia.  They also state that the elderly, children and pregnant women are particularly vulnerable.

The smoke can sometimes waft as I'm opening the door to load wood - I try to open it slowly so as to not bring smoke out of the firebox.  

I'm wondering if I'm being overly paranoid that the stove is contributing to our child's coughing/wheezing/drip or if I have a legitimate concern.

I'm going to contact our PCP tomorrow but I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with using a wood stove insert with little kids in the home and whether using the wood stove insert contributed to illness (cough or worse) for the little one(s).

My baby is exclusively breastfed and will be 4 months old in a few days. Since about 8ish weeks, she goes in cycles - she's either pooping 5-10x a day, or not pooping for 4-5 days in a row. When she goes days and days without a BM, she's fairly gassy and grumpy about it. She's a much happier baby when she's pooping more. :)

But for the life of me, I can't figure out why she's so inconsistent about it. I thought for sure it was my iron pill, so I cut that out of my diet about 3 weeks ago. She does seem happier since then, but was still a bit stoppered up until a few days ago.

I've cut dairy out of my diet twice and chocolate once and neither seemed to change anything. I still limit both things.

I don't eat/drink anything in excess and my diet is pretty well-rounded.

I'm just so confused why it goes back and forth so dramatically. Anyone have a clue?? I have been eating prunes for the past week to see if that helps her at all since she was so gassy/unhappy about not pooing.

Right now I&amp;#39;m bouncing back and forth between my car and friends houses. I got a job offer from a resort in Wyoming that will allow me to save up the money to get on my feet once I come back to California.

Everything from new parents posting pictures of their babies and preachy self-righteous posts about how to parent your child best, to linked articles about parenting and debates on differing disciplinary styles.

When I joined I expected it to be nothing but people posting a bajillion pictures of their kids and cat-fighting amongst the attachment parents and the free-range parents.  But I've found, unlike some people, that if I'm not interested in a topic, I can just not read it.  I found it to be a very enlightening moment when I first realized that I didn't have to read every topic in /r/parenting and could just skip over them.

Submitting links isn't my thing, i am more of a comments poster, so it was never part of my vision to come in here and make it what I want.  But then again, I didn't come here with a bunch of preconceived notions about how an established community should conduct themselves.  I just figured I'd contribute where I thought I could add value, ask questions when I didn't know the answer, and either enjoy the community or gradually get bored with it and stop reading it.  I hardly think anyone would care if I left - especially if I wasn't really contributing to the discussion anyway.

I can understand wanting to post pictures of your newborn, I really can. But I am not that interested in your baby, sorry, it's just me.  So you know what?  I don't look at those posts.  And if I happen to click on one accidentally, it only takes a moment to click the back button.  No biggie.

Best of luck.

Anyway, so Thursday we got an anti biotic called muiprocin, the next day she ended up getting hand foot mouth disease from daycare. This cause 104 fevers and the rash completely got pissed. It looks like I put my childs butt in a fire pit. It has never bothered her until now, its all blistery and nasty. So we went to the hospital on Saturday night, they gave me the run around because they too have no clue what in the hell this is. The put her back on nystatin with a coating of vaseling, she can't wear diapers, and she is in terrible pain. I am giving her tylenol for the pain and her fever broke but I just don't know what to do about this rash! The nystatin has not made a difference.

The problem is that our new home is a two-story loft, which means no bedrooms and you can see the entire house whether you are upstairs or downstairs. In our old home it wasn't much of problem because we had a room and could shut out stimulus by closing the door. 

Our upstairs serves as a bedroom, his crib (now daybed) is on one side of the room and our bed is on the other side. I can't get him to fall asleep in his bed anymore, he crawls out, gets excited because he knows we are downstairs.

I still remember feelING so alone and miserable. She shared a story of
her own with me that really helped me and I wanted to compare
different stories. From one angle I wanted to gather stories of people
in the space that I was before I experienced this, putting poop on the
walls - who would do such a thing? and how they would tell about it

(for me before I experienced it I would have had very negative
thoughts, I need some of these unexperienced stories too)...

From the other angle I want stories from parents of special needs, and
those without who have presepectives that it is just a fact of life
and how they would tell about it.

I am going to compare the stories showing to different cultures and
then compile them and make them avaiable so more people (hopefully)
know and feel comfort in the fact that they are not alone and it is
going to be okay.

http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kzhtm/is_there_a_subreddit_for_child_abuse_awareness/

So far there has been one comment.

With the number of people on IAMA who talk about being molested in childhood, I had hoped that there would have been a subreddit dedicated totally to how you can prevent child abuse. I have not found one yet.

I have gone through mild sexual abuse as a child and an adult. 

I wouldn't wish it on anyone's child. These thing take ages to heal from, and it is rare to be totally healed of the effects.

I just wish there is more talk about the subject, and that more parents would start teaching their kids to identify good touch and bad touch, and the ways to avoid abuse.


**EDIT** I should have been clearer in my posts, I am talking about child **sexual** abuse.

This is a good thing in a 2 parent household but when the father is not there to create balance, what happens is that the boy, because of his aggressiveness, is taught to always give way to the mother.  His aggressiveness is something that needs to be curtailed so the boy is raised to always feel like he is wrong about everything.

Well, long story short, the mattress popped.

We are new parents, and nursing has been a *little* tricky, only because he prefers to suck ON my nipple and I prefer he doesn't. We've gone back and forth on this question, and it had more or less been decided in the last few days. :)

Tonight he took a SUPER long nap (4 hours) and was really hungry when he woke up, and kept frantically latching on, but I had to break his latch because it was too shallow and painful. After a short while he nursed fine, but then he stopped. He'd still wave his head around and take my nipple into his mouth, but wouldn't latch back on and eat. He cried and got upset, but wouldn't nurse.

Finally, I tried him on the other side, and he nursed for five minutes or so (no latch drama this time) and then he stopped in the same weird way. He pulled back, made a face, cried, waved his mouth around looking for the nipple, played with the nipple in his mouth and then wouldn't nurse.

I'm wondering if it might have been something I ate. I even took a shower because I ate curry today, and wondered if he could smell the strong curry smell on me. (I could smell it with my super-duper new mama nose.) No go. My husband imagines it must be the ""hind milk"" because he sucked for a few minutes on each breast and then stopped.

Important Differences for me as a parent
-
- No way for kids to get out of the game other than the home button.  There are no ads, additional screens, in app purchase buttons, config buttons or anything else.  If the app is open all you see is the match game.

- No sounds.  This app does not make noise whether or not the kids are flipping the sound/vibration toggle.

- Has pictures of real animals and entertains the kids.  Ok, maybe this one isn't a differentiator.

He steals. He stole an adult's wallet and cellphone from some public place. He steals his mom's money and from other students.

Aaron lies all the time. And I mean ALL THE TIME. He lies about everything from doing his homework to wheter he brushed his teeth that day. He's not violent. He just lies and steals habitually. It is very difficult to get any truth from him - he skews stories and doesn't confess when confronted. (For example, he says he made a bet with his friends over a basket ball game.) With the money, he's bought an iPod.

He used to be very math/science smart. However, he's very proud and brags to his friends about himself, about how smart he is and how he has items of value (iPod). The reason I say ""used to"" is because he's stopped doing homework, saying things like he forgot the assignment at home, or that the teacher lost it, or that he forgot to do it. His grades have been slipping for maybe two years now.

Valentine has gone to three different counselors, and nothing has changed. She lives in a small town, so counselors/psychologists don't exactly abound. She's at her wit's end, and is seriously considering sending him to military school. I'm trying to encourage her not to, citing stories from /r/troubledteens, but she's extremely pessimistic right now. The wallet/cellphone incident hurt her a lot.

- son is 7

- potty trained since 3

- No problem for a little over 4 years


Problem:

- suddenly urine

- ALL THE TIME URINE


Over the course of the last week he's been having accidents both while awake and sleeping. This morning he woke up to a piss soaked mattress. Yesterday he had an accident in school. This is happening multiple times a day which leads me to think that it's some sort of medical issue and not simply a case of him being late to the toilet, although perhaps a time or two it could have been due to waiting too long. 

I am going to consult his pediatrician. 

But I'm curious how many of you have had an expereince like this and what you did to successfully get your child to stop having accidents? Short of asking him if he needs to pee every 30 minutes, I really don't have any good ideas to help. When we potty trained him it wasn't so much training as him saying, ""Okay, parental units, I'm ready"" and that was it. From then on he went to the toilet instead of his diapers. 


**Bonus points** if someone can give me advice on how I can relate this in a positive way to my 3 year old daughter who is currently potty training. 

Thanks guys!

right now, he has thrush and the pediatrician has recommended i not breastfeed until it clears up.  to keep my supply up and to still breastfeed i've been pumping every 4 hours.  i pump at 6 am, 10 am, 2 pm, 6 pm, 10 pm, and 2 am.  i only started doing this yesterday but i feel like my supply is low.  i pump anywhere from 1.5-4 ounces per pumping session.  is this a normal level?

today he seemed so hungry and i almost feel like i'm over feeding him.  for example, i fed him 5 ounces (3 breastmilk 2 formula) at 5:30.  then at 7 he was screaming for more food and downed 2 more ounces without a problem.  he is currently 9 lbs 13 oz so i don't think he's gaining too much weight, but the pediatrician told me he should only be eating 3 ounces every 3-4 hours and he wants a lot more than that.  i guess i'm just worried that i'm doing something wrong.  it's frustrating trying to get him as much breastmilk as possible but not being able to pump enough for him and feeling like i'm doing something wrong when he's screaming for more food even after eating 5 ounces...

I have been more than happy to do so, in the past, because it has been a wonderful quiet, bonding time for us. And even currently, for all of his naps throughout the day I really have no objection.

The only reason I'm ready to start moving away from this bad habit is suddenly (for the past 2 weeks-ish) he's decided to start waking at night 6+ times in a 12 hours period. I could associate this to possible teething (he may be, he's grumpier lately and his nursing has changed a bit) or perhaps something else, but I think that this is holding us back on him sleeping longer periods.

My goal is to move him into his crib in the nursery, as he currently is a bit too big for his travel crib (26 inches, 20.5 lbs), and I think that may contribute to his poor sleeping. I think he might kick in his sleep and hit the side and basically shove himself over and end up waking up. 

I was considering changing his final feeding before bed to formula to possibly fill him up for longer, but I'm not sure if that's why he wakes so many times. Would that be pointless?

Having children early is WAY BETTER than ""waiting until you are more settled down"". Why? You have more energy. Be honest, you are more fun. Because you are never really ""ready"". You could always make MORE money, have a BIGGER house, be FURTHER in your career... if you are happily married and you want children just do it. I will be 42 years old when my daughter turns 20. 

I used to have irrational (and even some rational) fears just like everybody else: but now I fear nothing. I would pry apart the wolfs' jaw for my daughter with courage. I would gladly lose a limb, or my life. Suffer the most terrible pain. It's kind of freeing in a way... I feel more content. 

I feel more content. I no longer worry if I will be able to provide for my family, because I know that I will. I WILL. no matter what. No matter what I have to do, it will happen. I have no shame, no pride, if it needs to be done it will be done. Talk about motivation... all lethargy out the window. 

The four years I've spent in college have trained in the art of persistent alertness. I do not sleep. And I'm fine with it - I function throughout my days with as much vigor as I used to and don't feel the effects.

My wife and I are at our wit's end, and it occurred to me what a great resource we have here at /r/parenting and /r/daddit.  I'm hoping to hear some advice on dealing with my youngest daughter...or at least a ""I've been there and it will all be ok"" or two.

We have two girls, 6 and 4, and they're complete opposites.  The 6 year old is helpful, largely independent, and emotionally consistent (for the most part).

The 4 year old has been a difficult child since birth, but my wife and I are really struggling lately.  Every morning, we wake her up at 6am or so to get ready for daycare and it's a fight.  Even if she was allowed to pick out her clothes the night before, she won't want that outfit in the morning.  Ask her to put on her shoes?  Fight.  Ask her to brush her teeth?  Tears.  In the evening, it's the same story.  She'll ask what's for dinner, and NO MATTER WHAT we say, it's a whining ""I don't want that!"" every time.  Bathtime?  Fight.  Bedtime?  Tears.  Everything.  All day.

Now on the flip side, when she's sweet, she is the sweetest, most loving little girl in the whole world.  She's also the most generous sharer I've ever seen.  She'll give anything to anybody.  She's proud of her sharing skills, too.

Unfortunately, the bad behavior is more the norm than the good.  It's tiring and my wife and I don't know what to do.  We've ignored it, addressed it calmly, resorted to yelling...everything except for physical discipline, which I will not use.  I believe girls will marry what their fathers model.

Premature closure of the sutures may cause the skull or facial bones to change from a normal, symmetrical appearance to an abnormal, asymmetrical appearance and may also cause the pressure inside of the head to increase.*

&lt;p&gt;Initials are RJAEC&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife&amp;#39;s parents are concerned it will be a giant PITA when dealing with bureaucracies, but the anecdotes online point to not a big deal.  Most people with multiple middle names use their &amp;#39;first middle name&amp;#39; for most forms without any issue.  No middle name appears to be a much bigger problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very common in several cultures to have 2 or 3 (or more) middle names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option is to hyphenate the two grandmother&amp;#39;s names...&lt;/p&gt;

To add to everything I had a cesarean delivery and just as I was starting to get back to normal from that I have come down with an infection and am on a very harsh antibiotic. With the sleep deprivation I am finding that my recovery is very very slow.

1. He will not clap, wave or mimic arm/body movement in any way yet. Most of our baby books and our pediatrician says they look for motion mimicry at around 7 months. He points to objects and is beginning to label them, but if you try to get him to wave or clap he just blank-stares.

2. He is completely oblivious to gravity. He's been holding his own bottle/sippy cup since about 10 months but he cannot grasp tilting the cup to make the liquid flow down to the mouth-piece. We had to buy sippy cups with straws or else we had to follow him around everywhere and tilt the cup for him. Once a week we try one of his old sippy cups and the problem persists, he just sucks on the end, getting more and more frustrated until he rages.

This is the worst! Dentist blames breast milk (still breastfed, but by no means exclusively). I think this is absolute kaka; so does La Leche League; so does Dr. Jack Newman (bf expert); so does Dr. Brian Palmer (dental expert). So at this point aggressive weaning is not on the menu.

My question is, just how important is it to get these teeth fixed? Seems that the ""they're just baby teeth"" approach has fallen out of vogue, and I certainly don't want to see him toothless before kindergarten. But is it worth the dental composite fillings that contain BPA, (I feel like I've worked way too hard to keep Babby and BPA at strict odds - can't reconcile with having some installed in his little Babby mouth) the stress of dental work, the risk of general anaesthesia/conscious sedation? 

This is what I am doing:
Attempting to tilt the balance of his diet from acid-forming to alkaline-forming.
Brushing twice daily with xylitol-containing toothpaste
Supplementing with vitamin D3, and soon with the Dental Essentials, as soon as it arrives (D3, K2, Ca, P).
Decreasing frequency and duration of breastfeeding at night.
I still put our water through an RO unit, so, no fluoride in the water.

Babby has never consumed processed foods, white flour, juice, or refined sugar with any regularity. Since his teeth has started to go, these foods have been all but eliminated.

If any parent out there has any experience with healing tooth decay through nutritional intervention, or with repairing it through conventional dentistry, either with GA or chloral hydrate, I am interested in your input!

3. Oldest is 2.5 years old
4. She's in love with robots, human anatomy, astronauts.
5. robots + humans = cyborg = darth vadar.  Darth Vadar in space = astronaut = awesome

OK. So already in shows like Word Girl, the villains are things that she likes (robots, meat, birthday obsessed) and they're really soft.  This lets her identify with them and she ends up being a little too morally gray.

She has always been a bit of a ""squeaker"" -- she would squeal and squeak in response to happy news, or something fun.  But in the last few months she has started just squeaking and peeping for no reason.  Like she will be in another room, watching TV, no one there, and sometimes she will just peep... every 10-20 seconds.  

Fast Forward to this month.  We were on our way to AZ on vacation and on the plane she started crossing her eyes and blinking really hard.  It was pretty freaky to watch actually and it was very obvious this wasn't something she was choosing to do.  She did it the whole trip and by the evening would tell us that it ""felt like her eyes were losing power and were about to go out"", etc.

Took her to GP and an optometrist.  Opt says her eyes are perfect.  No glasses needed, no focusing probs.  GP thought that the squeaks and the eye blinking/crossing were very much ""tic"" behaviours.  He said that they can be brought on by childhood stress, and to ensure that she has the opportunity to talk to us about how she is feeling, etc.

That confuses me a bit.  We have a really nice life.  My husband and I love and enjoy each other and there is no fighting or negativity in the house.  We have a new baby who is 8 months old, but the 5 year old adores her.  It wouldn't seem like she would be stressing her out.  And I feel like we are both so encouraging of the 5 year old, very loving, very open with hugs, kisses, and affection.  It is weird to think that she could have ""stress"".

It was pretty freaky to watch actually and it was very obvious this wasn&amp;#39;t something she was choosing to do.  She did it the whole trip and by the evening would tell us that it &amp;quot;felt like her eyes were losing power and were about to go out&amp;quot;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Took her to GP and an optometrist.  Opt says her eyes are perfect.  No glasses needed, no focusing probs.  GP thought that the squeaks and the eye blinking/crossing were very much &amp;quot;tic&amp;quot; behaviours.  He said that they can be brought on by childhood stress, and to ensure that she has the opportunity to talk to us about how she is feeling, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That confuses me a bit.  We have a really nice life.  My husband and I love and enjoy each other and there is no fighting or negativity in the house.  We have a new baby who is 8 months old, but the 5 year old adores her.  It wouldn&amp;#39;t seem like she would be stressing her out.  And I feel like we are both so encouraging of the 5 year old, very loving, very open with hugs, kisses, and affection.  It is weird to think that she could have &amp;quot;stress&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I go about figuring this out with my 5 year old?  I don&amp;#39;t know how to ask her about it without completely leading the questions.  I want to talk to her about how she feels, but I mean seriously, she is 5.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help?&lt;/p&gt;

619,12951,Parenting,1330629829,madaboutbaby,qdaps,One of the ladies at the daycare pushed my 10 mo. old daughter face first into her bed and held her down. ,"During nap time, my daughter was crying and sitting up in her bed. A witness told me that the teacher over the room pushed her face first into her bed and held her down as to force her into a napping position. Obviously this doesn't work and all she did was cry until said witness walked over and picked her up. I am holding back tears typing this.

My daughter is not hurt and I am a new father, but I don't feel like I am overreacting. The mother, who also works at that daycare (but in a different age room) went to the director today to talk about it only to be brushed off as if it wasn't a big deal. Her quote: ""I have never heard of any complaints about this person other than being lazy"". 


 I live in Tennessee and my daughter and her mother live in Alabama, or else I would be raising a lot of hell right now. I guess that is a good thing I am not closer. The mom and I are great friends and have a great parenting relationship but the distance in this situation makes me feel powerless and quite afraid that it will happen again if it hasn't already happened before. This includes the other kids in the room, not just my daughter. 

Can someone tell me to calm down? What can I or her mother do in this situation? I personally want to call the cops and tip them off to abuse (even if that is too harsh of a definition, I just want that lady and the director to be embarrassed!). But.. maybe I am overreacting, maybe I am being a little overprotective... but this kept me up all night and I need someone not related to me to talk to and tell me I'm an idiot or tell me what I should do next.

**Backstory:** My friend and his fiancee had a baby on Friday. She had been on the pill due to her heavy periods (no placebos, no monthly for her to miss). She apparently had a completely asymptomatic first two trimesters, which included an OB/Gyn visit at 5 months where the doctor failed to notice a blue spongy cervix or a 20+ week uterus, and did not do a pregnancy test at that time (an issue for later, but that will be dealt with as well).

The last two months, she started gaining weight and having some indigestion, though by then the possible diagnostic of ""This could be *late* pregnancy that I'm experiencing"" were not logically considered. They went to the ED with severe cramping that morning, and she delivered a 6lb, 15 ounce kid with ease, no decels, and Apgars of 9/9.

They *drank* a lot. The whole time. Kid looks and acts okay for day-of-life 3, but the level of exposure has been very high and near-continuous.

Among the unfathomable things they're going through right at this moment, I'm taking point position for them about FAS. So I'm the one that's accepting this worry (being a father, it's hitting me hard) for them.

Any links, suggestions, science, and help would be appreciated. TIA ParentIt.

What should I do?,"I would have never expected it - he's in honors courses, is level-headed and generally a great kid. But I found him with some paraphrenalia and when I examined his phone it became apparant he'd been selling weed to his friends. It looks like I caught him early, as it's only been a week, which is good. But overall I'm almost completely at a loss as to how to react.
EDIT: Thanks for all the advice.. To everyone who suggested calm communication - that was my approach. He claimed that he was doing it to get money to buy stuff, which doesn't really make sense to me. I suspect there were some additional motivations - peer acceptance, status, etc.  I tried to stress the potential negative consequences and fact that he had other options for getting money - e.g. asking for it from me, which usually works.
Our approach with punishment is probably going to be generally limiting his freedom for a while (grounding, loss of phone/internet), and banning certain 'friends' that we feel are a bad influence. From experience I know the friend ban is difficult if not impossible to enforce, but I think its still worth doing.

636,4880,Parenting,1311965265,kultcher,j3goc,My wife is freaking out that she made our unborn child fat. Anyone have any insight?,"So first off sorry if this isn't the most appropriate subreddit.

Anyway, here's the story: we're about two weeks out from our first child, a baby girl. Two months ago my wife was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. She had to go a strict low-carb diet to keep her blood sugar at the right level, and she handled it like a champ.

But after the latest ultrasound, we learned that the baby is measuring about a week too big, especially in the abdomen. She's already 8 pounds so she could be 9 or 10 by the time she comes.

My wife is now kinda freaked out afraid that she ""made her fat"" (my wife's a bit overweight herself), didn't do well enough on the diet, that the baby will be fat or unhealthy or have diabetes, and worried that natural labor will be hard or impossible.

Anyone have any insight to share on any of these things? Any other mom's have gestational diabetes or just plain fat/big babies and care to share any wisdom? Anything you can share might help ease our minds.

Thanks!

[voting on comments:](http://www.reddit.com/help/voting)
&gt;While the same rules generally apply to voting on the comments of others, reddiquette states that downvotes should be used for irrelevant comments, **not ideas you disagree with**; also don't be afraid to upvote a comment you disagree with if you think it is furthering the discussion. This will result in the most interesting and relevant discussions moving to the top of the comment page.

I've seen a lot of posts where people just plain disagree with each other and display their disgust by voting people's opinions and suggestions down. As parents we should be aware by now that just because you disagree with something doesn't mean it isn't a valid point. Part of learning to be a good parent and well rounded individual is getting as many sides of the story as possible before you make a decision. If you disagree with someone, and down vote their post, you are deciding *for someone else* what they will see and hear regarding their problem/issue/funny story. The truth is, that everyone has a valid point. And you should only be voting down things that don't contribute to a good discussion. **Not** the things that don't go along with your own personal parenting style.

The same goes for discussion. Some people are getting downright nasty in defense of their personal parenting decisions. Or pushy about what they think other parents should do. Don't do that. You don't like it when people do it to you, do you?

(I relate it to asking a Guantanamo Bay torturer for movie-violence advice... their exposure and opinion is so different from mine that there&amp;#39;s little chance we&amp;#39;ll agree.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our second choice based on the same factors is not affiliated with any church that we&amp;#39;re aware of, but it&amp;#39;s considerably more inconveniently located. (And for all we know they require prayer before snacks...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to parents who&amp;#39;ve been through this before -- and maybe even some Atheists among you -- what should we look for and/or ask about?&lt;/p&gt;

I'm 20 years old and I have a younger brother aged 17 that's been having some problems. He hasn't been doing well in school, and it's mostly due to an attitude problem. He doesn't really seem to have a big sense of responsibility, as in he things there'll be someone to take care of him. He doesn't keep track of his meetings, classes, music lessons, etc. He seems rather indifferent about positions where a lot of people rely on him. He just thinks that saying ""Oops, sorry"" will get him out of trouble.

In addition to being slightly irresponsible, he's a bit lazy. He likes to sleep in. He likes naps, taking his time while eating, browsing on the web, eye-shopping on the web, etc. He doesn't seem to realize that he's in a lot of trouble right now academically. 

It's true that he's going through puberty and his frontal cortex has not matured yet. However, my parents and I do see a difference between me and my brother when we were going through puberty. My mother has a really hot temper, and she's managed to tone it down. While that has improved her high blood pressure, my brother seems to take advantage of it. He used to be rather scared of her when she became angry, but now that she doesn't get angry so much anymore, he talks to her in a really disrespectful manner. 

Sorry it's a bit disorganized right now. I'm really worried about my brother and English is not really my native language. I hope that someone can really help my brother out.

Boil water, cool for 30 minutes, use sterilized tongs to handle bottle accessories, really?  Another article was saying to avoid pre-making bottles and refrigerating due to bacteria build up - am I really expected to spend 30 minutes making a bottle every 2-3 hours or are these instructions just overkill?  The powdered formula we have just essentially says, ""Get water, add powder, done"" with no mention of boiling.  Also, what are your thoughts on this and the whole ""do not store prepared formula"" thing?

I don't want to endanger my kid's health so I'll obviously do whatever needs to be done, but I also don't want to be an overly paranoid parent, sterilizing everything in sight.  I need help! Thanks in advance for any comments or opinions.

&lt;p&gt;I can think of dozen&amp;#39;s of daily examples of things like this. I know that he has to have these types of experiences to learn, but I can&amp;#39;t fight the overwhelming urge to prevent him from hurting himself, even in minor ways. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, if the possibility of injury isn&amp;#39;t there, I always allow him to learn things and explore for himself. But, I often wonder, where is the line? Am I a hover parent?&lt;/p&gt;

My wife took a pregnancy test a couple of days before her period and it came out positive!

However, over the course of the next few days she had some light bleeding. According to her it was occasional spotting throughout two days, which got her very worried. All in all, she had light bleeding - light enough that she kept wearing just a pantie liner vs. an out and out pad - through two days and then just a drop or two on day three. Here we are on day five with no blood from the previous two days. The pregnancy tests still report positive.

Is this something for concern? Right now we feel like we are in limbo, not sure if the pregnancy is a go or if there was some problem with implantation. My thought is that the bleeding (it seems) was not significant - not at all like a regular period, according to my wife - and has been non-existent for two days now and the pregnancy tests are still reporting positive. Therefore, things are looking up. My wife is being a little more pessimistic, I think, to not get her hopes up too high.

Our current plan is to adopt a wait and see approach for the next week or two. If the blood resumes or a normal period commences, we'll know it's a no go. If there is no more bleeding for the next couple of days/weeks then we'll presume the pregnancy is on and go setup our first appointment with our midwife.

In fact, none of his baby teeth are loose. I'm just curious as to how big of a deal this is. Will the baby tooth eventually come out on it's own, or will I have to take him to a dentist to have it pulled?

Her father left this morning for a 2 week fishing trip in Canada.  She has never spent a single night away from my mother or step-father, and she is very upset.

He now regrets going, but there is no way for him to come home early.  His friends drove him, and we can not afford the plane ticket home...so he has to be gone for the entire 2 weeks.  Also, there is not electricity at the islands they are at in Canada, and no cell reception.  They are getting a satellite phone, but from what I understand, that is very expensive ($1 per min. ?)

He thought that she could handle it and would not be upset, but as soon as it starts to get dark, she starts to get upset.   She has before, even when she was over at grandmas house being babysat while they were at the movies or something.

Like I said, he is to be gone for 2 weeks.  She is very smart, but does not understand time...and i am afraid that she will not understand that he IS coming home.  My worst fear is that she will feel abandoned...

&lt;p&gt;He now regrets going, but there is no way for him to come home early.  His friends drove him, and we can not afford the plane ticket home...so he has to be gone for the entire 2 weeks.  Also, there is not electricity at the islands they are at in Canada, and no cell reception.  They are getting a satellite phone, but from what I understand, that is very expensive ($1 per min. ?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He thought that she could handle it and would not be upset, but as soon as it starts to get dark, she starts to get upset.   She has before, even when she was over at grandmas house being babysat while they were at the movies or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said, he is to be gone for 2 weeks.  She is very smart, but does not understand time...and i am afraid that she will not understand that he IS coming home.  My worst fear is that she will feel abandoned...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can we do to help her?  Is there anything?  I am just afraid of this hurting her in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any of the help you can give me and my sister and mother.&lt;/p&gt;

But my wife is British, I've lived in Mexico, and goddammit, I don't want my kids growing up to be stereotypical American monolinguals like I was. 

In this school from K-6 each kid spends half his day with the teacher speaking English, half Spanish. By 3rd grade a lot of these kids are fluent. 

So today my kid comes home from school with a present. He opens it at home and there are gloves, a knit hat, candy, star wars legos--like $50 worth of nice stuff. WTF, I ask myself?

I tell Grandma in the nicest way possible to shut the fuck up. My 6 year old is not going to sell crack because his best friend is Hispanic. But man, it's getting old.

I know I know everyones kid is the cutest and smartest but objectively she&amp;#39;s a few standard deviations above the rest on the cuteness/intelligence meter. Maybe it was my spartan upbringing but I just can&amp;#39;t agree with how others give her feedback and how I am perceived for doing the opposite. If she belts out a few notes from her upcoming Christmas pageant I&amp;#39;m going to tell her she needs to bring it down a notch, less diva, and not shower her with gilded compliments. She&amp;#39;s  self confident almost to a fault.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is my opinion that the PC, wishy-washy, crust-removed 90&amp;#39;s parenting style is responsible for an entitlement epidemic with kids today. Everyone&amp;#39;s the best. They don&amp;#39;t think they need improvement because they don&amp;#39;t receive criticism. Does anybody agree or am I completely off-base?&lt;/p&gt;

She is a great student, always borderline honor roll. Ten years old now. Always has exemplary citizenship scores, except when refusal to do homework affects it.

She is particularly good at ""forgetting"" her books at school.

We started her at a private school and the absolute last thing i told her before her first day was ""we're not putting up with you skipping homework this year."" And the first day she left her math book at home so she could not complete her only assignment.

I'm a fairly progressive parent. I don't spank my child, because I felt like it didn't benefit me as a child. I also know that homework really isn't the most important, helpful part of learning, but at the same time, it is incredibly easy for her and takes almost no time.

Me and her mom were never together. We are somewhat communicative. She spends a week at my house and a week at her house. One of my concerns is that a steady routine can't be reached because the mother is incredibly lackadaisical, but i might be able to impart the importance of this matter to her sufficiently.

If any more info is needed, please ask. I need advice on how to progress. I would like to find a solution to this before she gets to middle school proper, and also so she can take advantage of the better education i'm paying for.

My daughter is 5 and is attending Kindergarten, she has always been shy so we were thrilled when we learned she made a best friend. The two girls absolutely love playing together and they are always together at school.

My daughter and her friend have been bugging us parents to have a play date. After we got to know her friends mom a little better we agreed to let her stay at her friends house for a few hours one day after school. My wife has even spent time there getting to know her mom as well. Plus, before I agreed to let her stay there I checked the sex offender map and nothing turned up. 

A few days ago, her school sent out a notice notifying parents that a registered sex offender has moved into the area and the address listed is her best friends house.

So what would you do if you found out your child's best friend was living with a sex offender? 

Should we talk to her mom about this?

There is alot of information given about this on the registry. It was about 10 years ago, in another city, he was in his mid 30s the victim was 14. There is no known relationship to the victim.

We are easy-going parents that tend to go by baby's cues. This worked very well with our (now almost 5) daughter. The son seems to be going well, but not exactly how *we* want. He is three months and still wants to be swaddled. He freaks out and starts coughing if we put him on his back, basically, he sleeps very well and very soundly... in his swing. Is it safe to keep him there? I want to put him on his back, but the coughing sways me. it's been cold season anyways, and we live in an allergen rich area. If he really can't breathe flat on his back I'm all for anything else. Midway through the night he wakes up and I nurse him, then lay with him on the couch the rest of the night. He invariably wakes about 7:30 (I don't *like* it, but I have to wake at 8 for daughter, so no biggie). I know the couch is listed as a less than ideal place, but I promise it is not in this case- I can go into details if you want, but I've put a lot of consideration into this.

Basically, my problem is this: He has a schedule, and it works out great. Unfortunately, none of it involves him laying on his back to sleep, and I also cannot sleep with my husband for any reasonable length of time because the big bed would kill my back and be more dangerous for him to sleep in. I keep resolving to change his schedule, but it's so difficult when we're talking sleep (did I mention I also have an almost five year old ball of energy to boot?).

It may be a case of confirmation bias but I think it's as simple as that. We have plenty of friends with kids and their kids are sick a bunch. Runny noses, coughs, stomach aches.

My two girls (ages 5 and 8) have missed a combined total of 3 days of school last year due to illnesses. I can count on both hands the number of fevers they've had together in the past two years.

Judging from the number of kids who hang out at our house and *don't* do this it doesn't seem to be a big thing among other parents. You'd think this would be obvious.

Then again, judging from the number of *adults* I've seen in public restrooms, I guess this has never been a big thing.  Yuck.

Prior to staying home I had a job in consulting I loved. I miss it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband and I have tried to set aside an hour or two a week for me to get out of the house and do something fun without the kiddos. I usually either go to the gym or out with girlfriends. The past five weeks I have given up my &amp;#39;free&amp;#39; time so he could either go out fishing with his dad, or drinking with guys from work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He will be out of town at the end of July for a week (work conference). The second week in August is his annual camping/fishing trip. He takes three (separete) weeks in the fall/winter for hunting trips. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy he has hobbies/active social calendar. We were both very active prior to having children. I have stopped most of my social commiments and hobbies, because of lack of time and childcare. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may sound bitchy, but I want my payback. He has skated out of too much, and now I feel cheated....what should I ask for? &lt;/p&gt;

My name is Meghan Corbett and I���������m doing a senior thesis in product design at the University of Notre Dame. My thesis deals with the issue of safety for lap held children under two years of age on airplanes. I am interested in understanding your thoughts and concerns around this issue but I am also interested in the overall challenge of traveling with small children.

I am hoping to chat with some parents over Skype or other chat program to help me understand the real problems you have experienced while traveling with young children. The information I gather from these interviews will help me in the design of my safety product and ensure that my design will meet real needs.

If interested, you can contact me here or by emailing me at mcorbet2@nd.edu. I look forward to getting your feedback.

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Reddit parents!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Meghan Corbett and I���������m doing a senior thesis in product design at the University of Notre Dame. My thesis deals with the issue of safety for lap held children under two years of age on airplanes. I am interested in understanding your thoughts and concerns around this issue but I am also interested in the overall challenge of traveling with small children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am hoping to chat with some parents over Skype or other chat program to help me understand the real problems you have experienced while traveling with young children. The information I gather from these interviews will help me in the design of my safety product and ensure that my design will meet real needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If interested, you can contact me here or by em""mailto:mcorbet2@nd.edu""&gt;mcorbet2@nd.edu&lt;/a&gt;. I look forward to getting your feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you,
Meghan Corbett&lt;/p&gt;

It's my 40th birthday and my wife just came in to tell me she's pregnant again.  We already have two great kids, and we were not planning to have any more.  We've been using birth control (condoms) and haven't noticed any mishaps, but the little blue line on the stick doesn't seem to lie.

We are both in shock and unsure what to think or do.  Our second son was a surprise, but a welcome one.  This is not the same.  We are 6 years older and really enjoy having kids who have grown to some level of independence.  This feels like ""starting over"" and not in a good way.  

We remember the many sleepless nights as both of our children had stomach problems and ""caulic"".  I would have to stay up hours and hours swinging them in their carrier, or patting them on the back to sooth them.  Our children are joys, but as babies they were nightmares.

My wife had preeclampsia both times.  The nurses told her last time she was lucky and should not have any more children.  We agreed.  Now I find myself hoping the doctor will tell us it is too dangerous to keep this one.  I feel terrible for having such thoughts.

Even if the risk is minimal, we have to question if going through with this is the right thing.  Would we be using health concerns as an excuse?  I do not want to have another child.  Is it wrong to have another child?

I think the worst part of it is not being able to discuss it with anyone else.  Part of you wants to scream to the world that you are going through such thoughts and questions, but until we know for sure if we will be going through with it we cannot confide in our friends.  At least I have an anonymous means to vent.  For that I am thankful.

He fell awkwardly (I saw it; it really wasn't a big deal) while playing with his older brother and came up crying and holding his hand. He went into a quick breath or two to start crying, then exhaled with his mouth open like he was trying to scream but didn't have any more air...and held it a good 20-25 seconds. He turned blue and his eyes just started to roll a bit when he relaxed/collapsed in my arms and inhaled and went on to cry normally and awake. 

He's done this just a few times since he was born...by our count this is the 5th time. Actually, he did this right after he was born (literally right as he came out). He held his breath for about 15 seconds while the doc kept urging him to breath in. Suddenly he sucked in a breath then we heard that glorious first cry. 

Anyway, my wife brought him in to the doc today and they checked his heartbeat and asked about his iron intake. She said he checked out perfect and diagnosed him as a breath holder, plain and simple. She warned us that as he gets older he'll probably do it with tantrums from time to time. So far, it's only happened when he has a big fall or gets a bump or something. 

Does anyone else have any experience with breath holders? Were you a breath holder?

* Call him out loudly, saying something like ""how dare you treat your kid that way?!"", hoping others will chime in or support me.

* Call him out personally.

* Threaten violence if he ever does it again.  I would just be bluffing.

* Record a video, report to authorities.  Parent may not even damage the child again on camera so I'd be ""lucky"" to catch him.

In all of these situations, he could just say ""fuck you, it's none of your business"".  He may get even angrier and take it out on the child later.  I could also get punched in the face.  I'd take it if it meant the child never gets hurt again, but that's unlikely.

As horrible as this sounds it apparently has a really high success rate. Well, it *is* really horrible listening to your baby cry and not doing anything about it. So the first night went fairly well, but the second night he took almost an hour to fall asleep. he woke up only an hour later and was hysterical for almost 2 hours. I was there for the first night but I work at night, so when I got home at around 11:00pm he was still screaming.

When he was born he was already into size 1 diapers weighting in at 9.8 pounds at birth. Lately it seems like his sizes are off... I was trying to go by the weights on the diapers we were given which suggested the size 2s starting at 12 pounds. The issue is though that they don't seem to fit him right around the middle. My son doesn't have the girth they are assuming comes with being over 14 pounds. I would still stick to the size 1s but they are seeming to get tight on his legs. I guess what I am asking is what signs should I be looking for to indicate a switching in sizes?

My friends mother, while being a grea help, is very busy and unable to take any time off to help a new mother in the first few days.

So, as experienced parents, what would you think would be helpful to her? I live about 1.5 hrs away so it's not like I can just play it by ear and drop in when she needs me, I also have a job so I can't take too much time off to help but am in the unique position to be one of the few people she would want help from. All that said, what would make her life easier in the next few days?

TLDR, my friend gave birth yesterday, her husband and close family are either useless or unwelcome/unable to help her in the first few days as a new mum, what would have made it easier on you and how can I do those things without being too in the way?
 Edit: I'm wondering mostly about 'the da they come home' aspect of being here, I don't want to be underfoot and imposing.

Just had to tell someone.

Is this normal?","My darling 2 1/2 year old daughter has been developmental late in just about every aspect of life. She didn't walk until a year and a half. She is still behind in talking. She was classified as ""failure to thrive"" until just recently because of her size. She just recently started to talk coherently instead of babbling.  She has finally reached the height where she can actually get things for herself. She has grown a lot in the past few months.

Lately, though, I've noticed that with that growing has come a new attitude. She is a bully to the other kids in her class, she throws things on the floor, and she will rip magazines for no reason. She doesn't really act that way around me, I've noticed. All I know is what the teacher tells me along with the smaller stuff I see.

Now she has always been feisty and a mommy's-girl, but it's apparently getting out of control at her daycare. And no amount of punishment will stop her. She just smiles as if to say ""eff you."" Then goes right back to what she was doing. 

I'm beginning to wonder if this is normal terrible 2 behavior or something more... has anybody else experienced this, and, if so, what did you do to cause your child to mellow down and stop being a little (albeit cute) monster?

The thing is, many of the responses (correctly) say that I am not enforcing my authority, and that I need to start doing that.  Believe me, I want to.

My question is: HOW????  Everything I can think of involves physical force, or cajoling/bribing, taking stuff away, or ignoring.  I read once that when you have true authority, you don't need to resort to those things; just giving a certain kind of look or talking in a certain tone of voice causes people to fall into line.

To continue the bedtime example (since that's the hardest one), how do I physically force someone to stay in their room besides locking them in (cruel)?  If I bribe them, that implies that they can choose whether to get the reward or forgo it and do what they want.  Same with taking stuff away.  Ignoring them will just result in nighttime anarchy.

And the whining/complaining is driving me crazy.  I just don't know what to do.  If I send them to their rooms (not possible in the car, unfortunately), they refuse to go until I escalate the threats or physically put them into there (not easy, I'm afraid I'm going to hurt my back one of these days).

But now that I am a mother, I've just become so paranoid. If I put my daughter on the changing table and she cries, I get freaked out and question him about why she is crying while being changed. I worry about when she becomes a teenager and starts looking like a woman and how he will feel about it. Above all, I feel extremely guilty for these emotions because my husband is such a wonderful partner and an amazing father. I know he loves me and our baby more than anything. He just called and I told him about the story on the front page about the baby getting molested by her father and how it disturbed and upset me. He said he understood how that could be upsetting but that I know he would never ever do anything like that.

I worry about when she becomes a teenager and starts looking like a woman and how he will feel about it. Above all, I feel extremely guilty for these emotions because my husband is such a wonderful partner and an amazing father. I know he loves me and our baby more than anything. He just called and I told him about the story on the front page about the baby getting molested by her father and how it disturbed and upset me. He said he understood how that could be upsetting but that I know he would never ever do anything like that. 
But I still can&amp;#39;t help but think about the mother who this happened to and how she probably never saw it coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should have posted this in advice or confessions but I want to hear from other parents. Anyone who had similar fears and overcame them or advice/reassurance on how to deal with these emotions would be really helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

A couple google hits indicate some danger, so we&amp;#39;re going to enroll in some local classes that deal with choking and infant CPR, but I&amp;#39;d like to hear what r/Parenting has to say on this. &lt;/p&gt;

2. Go in for an appt. next Wednesday and have some sort of cervix loosening gel applied.

3. If we haven't delivered naturally by next Friday (1 week after due date) then we would go in and have my wife induced.

Kid has a snowsuit for winter of course, but it gets very cold and windy here, such that there will be many weeks worth of cold snaps to fill without playing in the snow together.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m tired of reading nursery rhymes and dr.seuss and pointing out words for the pictures we see in her books.  It&amp;#39;s getting dull!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr:  So, what are some fun indoor activities that you do with your kids under 2? Assume a limited budget, but I&amp;#39;m open to ideas on things I can invest in that will be fun for a while.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

994,10911,Parenting,1326880875,babyquestions2012,om8j9,Risks of drinking alcohol and taking pain meds around the time of conceiving? (xpost with askscience),"Hello Parenting,

I (male) am trying to find out what the risks attached with these two things are around conception.

The trouble is, almost every article or comment is simply phrased as ""do this"" or ""don't do this"" without any attempt to quantize the risks. Is this because we don't really know what they are?

Specifically, what I'd like to know (for starters!) is what the level of risk to a potential foetus is from mum-to-be drinking alcohol around conception -- some commenters suggest that because the foetus doesn't start taking blood from the placenta until 4-6 weeks after conception that there is zero risk associated with alcohol consumption around the time of conception -- so if we were to do a pregnancy test every 2 weeks and stop when it turns positive, we'd be perfectly safe. Is this true?

Same with painkillers -- my partner has chronic back pain and it would be useful to her to be able to keep taking the ibuprofen / co-codamol for as long as possible, instead of having to abstain prior to conception.

There clearly appear to be well-known risks with alcohol (FAS etc) post-conception, but what about over-the-counter painkillers?
